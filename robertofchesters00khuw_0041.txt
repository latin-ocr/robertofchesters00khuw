CHAPTER III

RossERT OF CHESTER AND OTHER TRANSLATORs OF ARAsslc
INTo LAT1N

WHEN towards the beginning of the twelfth century European
scholars turned to Islam for light, the works of Mohammed ibn
Musa came to occupy a prominent place in their studies. One
of the first of these students was styled John of Seville,¹ or of
Luna, or of Spain, whose name is attached to some manuscript
copies of an adaptation of Al-Khowarizmi's arithmetic. Thus,
the version, mentioned above, published by Prince Boncompagni‚
bears the title, joannis Hispalensis liber Algorismz' de pralz'ca
arismetrz'ce, and in a sub-head the editing of the arithmetic is
ascribed to John of Spain. This work contains also a very brief
treatment of algebra, entitled Exceptz'ones de libro, qui dicitur
gleba 7722zlab2'l2'cz.‘² Res is employed for the square of the unknown,
and radix for the unknown, the usage being, in this respect,

unique. The problems, ο
x“÷ lox: 39,

3x-l- 4 =x“,
occur as in Al-Khowarizrni, with a variation in the second type,
‚2³4- 9 = ox.

The authorship is in question, since some manuscripts ascribe the
work to Gerard of Cremona, some to John of Spain, and others
are anonymous. However, no doubt now exists that John of
Spain was familiar with the arithmetic of Al-Khowarizmi‚ for
Dominicus Gundisallinus, co-laborer with John in translating from
the Arabio, mentions the Liber algorismi in the chapter on arith-
metic of the De divisione philosophiae-,³³ About 1133 A.D. Bishop
Raimund of Toledo commissioned John of Spain to work with
Gundisallinus on translations from the Arabio. John made the
translation into Spanish, and this was put into Latin by Gun-

¹ Steinschneider. Dic chr. Uehem, p. 981, and note 82. p. 380.
² Unintelligible Latin forms for “ algebra w* almucabala.”
