THE INFLUENCE OF AL-KHOWARIZMI'S ALGEBRA 41

A few words about the life 01 Scheybl ¹ may be 01 interest. His
student days include an early stay at the University 01 Vienna,
made famous in matheniatical studies by Peurbach and Regiomon·
tanus. In 1532 Scheybl matriculated at Tiibingen, which was a
stronghold of Protestantism, and in 1535 he was a student there.
In 1540 he was Magister in Tiibingen, and four years later Docent
in rnathematics. After another period 01 about five years we find
him Professor (ordinarius) of Euclid, and in 1555 Professor 01
Euclid and Arithmetic. How little some aspects 01 university
1116 have changed during four centuries is shown by the fact that
Scheybl twice, in 1551 and 1562, requested 01 1116 university
authorities an increase of salary in order that he might pay his
debts and obtain the necessaries 01 life. In addition to the
treatises on geometly and algebra which have been mentioned,
Scheybl published other works on geometry and arithmetic.

As late as the end 01 1116 sixteenth century an able mathema-
tician‚ Adrien Romain, deemed the algebra 01 Al-Khowarizmi
sufficiently worthy 01 serious study to justify him in publishing a
commentary on the work. The version upon which Romain
based his study is that 01 Robert 01 Chester. In the course 01
1115 commentary he gives small portions 01 11115 1131151311011. At
the time 01 writing this, according to Bosmans2 in 1598 or 1599,
Romain was teaching in W'urzburg. His student and teaching
life covered periods 01 residence in Germany, Italy, and Poland,
besides his native Louvain where he studied and taught.
