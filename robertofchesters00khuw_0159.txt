ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 129

SOME ADDITIONS IN EXPLANATION OF THE ALGEBRA

We find a triple combination of squares,1 namely squares and roots equal
to numbers, squares and numbers equal to roots, and finally roots and
numbers equal to squares.

An Illustration of tlte First Type

A square and 8 of its roots equal 3 3 units. The question is, what is the
square ? ² Answer : 9.

The rule is to add to the number the product of half of the root multiplied
by itself, that is 16 to 33, and 49 is obtained, of which the root is 7. Now
from this root we subtract one-hali of the number of the roms, namely 4,
which leaves three. This is the root of the square, and the square is 9.³

Likewise if you are given that two squares and eight roots are equal
to 42 units. Reduce in the following manner to one square. If two squares
and eight roots are equal to 42 units, then one square and four roots are
equal to 21. You operate therefore by duplication and arrive in the end
at the desired result}

Likewise if you are given one—half a square and four roots equal to 16}
units. Reduce the problem to a whole square, take one-half of the whole,
and in the end you arrive at the desired result.⁵

An Illustralion of the Second Type

A square and fifteen units equal eight roots. What then is the square?
Answer: 9 or 25.

Rule. Multiply one-half of the roots by itself, and 16 is obtained. From

this subtract the 15 units and one is obtained, of which you subtract the

root, namely one„ from one-half of the roots. This gives 3 as the root of

the square. Or add that one to one-half of the roots and 5 is obtained as

the root of the square. It is clear then that the problem is solved by each
value, and hence it is necessary to determine separately both solutionsfi

C orollary

It should be noted that if the square of half of the roots is less than the
proposed number, as, for example, a square and the number 15 equal to
6 roots, then the problem is not solvable.⁷ If the square of one-half of the
roots is equal to the given number7 as, for example, a square and 9 units
equal to 6 roots, then the half of the roots is the root of the square. More-
over, if a problem is proposed involving more than one square or less than
a whole square, reduce to one square. and operate as indicated above.
