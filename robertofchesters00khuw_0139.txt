THE BOOK OF ALGEBRA AND ALMUCABOLA 109

Explanation. You multiply 10 - x by itself, giving 100 and x² less
20 x. Then multiply x by itself, giving x2. Collecting the products of
these two multiplications you obtain 100 and 236-Ἇ less 20x equal to 58.
Complete the 100 plus 2οε2 less 20x by adding the 20x to 58. This gives
100 units -÷- 2x² equal to 58 units and 20x. Now you reduce this to one
square, and then by oppositionl you take 29 from 50, leaving 21 ÷ x² equal
to 10x. Therefore you halve the roots, giving 5. Multiply this by itself,
giving 25. From this you subtract 21 and 4 is left. Take the root of this,
2, and subtract it from 5, i.e. from the half of the roots. This gives 3 which
represents. of course, one part of ten. So this problem has led you to the
fifth of the six Chapters in which we treated the type, a square and num-
bers equal to roots.

Sixtlz problem, illustrating tlte sixth chapter

I multiply ἐκ and {x in such a way as to give x itself plus 24 units.²

Explanation: first you observe that when you multiply {x by {x you
obtain ὲ of ὲχῗ equal to x ἢ» 24 units. The multiplication of ὲ of ὲχῗ by 12
gives the complete square. Similarly, the multiplication of x 4— 24 units
gives 12x ÷ 2883 which equal x2. Therefore take one-half of the roots and
multiply the half by itself. Add the product of this multiplicatiori to 288,
giving 324. Take now the root of this, i.e. 18, and add it to the half of the
roots. The root finally is 24. So this problem has led you to the sixth of the
six chapters in which we treated the type, roots and numbers equal to a
square.4

errEEN ADDITIONAL PROBLEMs⁵

It now remains for us to treat sixteen other problems which seem to arise
out of the six which we have set forth, in order that the craftsman versed
in this art may more easily and without any error solve any problem
proposed.⁶

¹ This operation corresponds to the Arabic term al muqabala. In this instance the 29 on the
right balances or cancels an equal amount of the 50 on the left.

2}x.}x =x ÷24; x² = 12x ÷2883 {of 12 is 6,62 =36‚ 288 436 =324, 4332 = 18,
18 -ι- 6 = 24, which is the value of the unknown.

³ Evidently Robert of Chester wrote the word for two-hundred out in full, or in Roman nu-
merals, and the 88 in Hindu-Arabic numerals, for both the Dresden and Scheybl versions use this
form, separating the two-hundred from the 88.

⁴ The above six problems appear in this order in all of the versions.

The terminology of the fourth and sixth problems is the same in the Arabic text, although
Rosen, op. crit„ pp. 38, 40 translates differently the same expression: ‘⁴ I have multiplied one-
third of thing and one dirhem by one-fourth of thing . . . ''; ¹⁸ Ι have multiplied one-third of
a root by one-fourth of a root . . .'’ The Libri text has census in both problems, and the
Boncompagni text has multitudo ,² the Arabic word is mal with the meaning—(footnote 1, p. 107)
“unknown quantity.''

⁵ Ι have added this title to correspond to the Arabic (Rosen, op. cit„ p. 41).

⁶ This paragraph is an addition by Robert of Chester.
