MANUSCRIPTS OF ROBERT OF CHESTER'S TRANSLATION 59

lines 22—24: The length of this omission is 45 letters. On
page 110, in line 27, there is an omission by the Vienna scribe of
some 36 letters, but as the passage is not at all clear in the
Dresden Ms.‚ having unamquamque where antequam unamquam-
que should have been written, this may have been a deliberate
omission. The omission in the text of page 100, line 19, which is
sliort'(about 20 letters) may also have been deliberate as the
meaning is not clear. Another short omission is found in the
text to page 78, line 12.

As these omissions in the Vienna Ms. correspond to portions
of the Arabic text, and as all are found in the Dresden Ms., they
establish the fact that the Vienna Ms. is not the ancestor of the
Dresden Ms.; similarly the omissions of the Dresden Ms. are
found in the Vienna Ms., proving that the Dresden could not be
the parent Ms. of the Vienna Ms., entirely apart from the fact that
the Vienna is quite definitely older.

In the Dresden Ms. some eleven omissions require examina-
tion. Of these eight are instances where the scribe has passed
from one word or phrase to a similar word or phrase recurring in
the adjacent text. Such omissions are, as we have noted, quite
likely to be about the length of the line of the parent Ms., but may
be materially shorter or longer. Five of these omissions also sug-
gest a line of about forty letters in the parent ΜΞ. Four of these
omissions are rectified by marginal additions made by a second
hand, but this does not change their value as indicating the length
of line in the parent. Four of these omissions are indicated in the
footnote to line 6, page 92. The first from fuerint to fuerint; the
second from sine re to sine re,· the third from procreant to pro-
creant, and so also the fourth although here a 10 intervenes. The
lengths in letters are 37, 43, 16, and 38, respectively. In line 7
on the same page is another short omission, from like to like, in
the expression, et eius sextam in dragma et eius sextam; the
Dresden MS. omits the last five words. In the first line on the
same page we have the evident omission of a full line, no recur-
ring word appearing.

A much longer omission than any yet mentioned is found on
page 94, lines 34—36:

. . . perueniet una substantia abiecta. Et si dixerit 10 sine re
in re⁷ dicas 10 in re 10 res procreant, et sine re in re substantiam
