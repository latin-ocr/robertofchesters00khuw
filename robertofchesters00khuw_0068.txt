46 INTRODUCTION

“The learned in times which have passed away, and among nations which have
ceased to exist, were constantly employed in writing books on the several depart-
ments of science and on the various branches of knowledge, bearing in mind those
that were to come aster thern, and hoping for a reward proportionate to their ability,
and trusting that their endeavors would meet with acknowledgement, attention, and
remembrance———content as they were even with a small degree of praise; small, if
compared with the pains which they had undergone, and the difficulties which they
had encountered in revealing the secrets and obscurities of science.

“Some applied themselves to obtain information which was not known before them,
and lest it to posterity ς others commented upon the difficulties in the works left by
their predecessors, and defined the best method (os study), or rendered the access
(to science) easier or placed it more within reach3 others again discovered mistakes
in preceding works, and arranged that which was confused, or adjusted what was
irregular, and corrected the faults of their fellow-laborers‚ without arrogance towards
them, or taking pride in what they did themselves.

“ That fondness for science, by which God has distinguished the Imam al Mamun,
the Commander of the Faithful (besides the caliphat which He has vouchsafed unto
him by lawful successim, in the robe of which He has invested him, and with the
honours of which He has adorned him), that affability and condescension which he
shows to the learned, that promptitude with which he protects and supports thern in
the elucidation of obscurities and in the removal of difficulties,—has encouraged¹
rne to compose a short work on Calculating by (the rules of) Completion and Re-
duction, confining it to what is easiest and most useful in arithmetic, such as men
constantly require in cases of inheritance, legacies, partition, law-suits, and trade,
and in all their dealings with one another, or where the measuring of lands, the dig-
ging of canals, geometrical computation, and other objects of various sorts and kinds
are concerned—relying on the goodness of my intention therein, and hoping that
the learned will reward it, by obtaining (sor me) through their prayers the excellence
of the Divine mercy: in requital of which, may the choicest blessings and the
abundant bounty of God be theirs! My confidence rests with God, in this as in
everything, and in Him I put my trust. He is the Lord of the Sublime Throne.
May His blessing descend upon all the prophets and heavenly messengers l '⁷

The Arabic version differs from the Latin translations which
have come down to us, in giving an extended discussion of inheri-
tance problems and also in discussing geometrica] measurements.
In the English translation by Rosen the inheritance problems, in-
volving largely legal questions rather than algebraical ones, occupy
79 pages as opposed to 70 for the algebra proper. The mensuration
problems take some sixteen pages of text. The formulas are

1Several writers have asserted that the work of Al-Khowarizmi was written at the
request of the caliph. The text shows that this is not Al-Khowarizmi's statement os
the case.
