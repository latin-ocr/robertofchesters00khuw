THE BOOK OF ALGEBRA AND ALMUCABOLA 103

If you wish to multiply the root of 3 by the root of 3, you multiply 3 by 3,
giving ὲ. The root of this one-sixth is that which we obtain by the multi-
plication of the root of ὲ by the root of 3.

Again if you wish to multiply two roots of 9 by three roots of 4‚¹ take two
roots of 9 according to the method which we have explained so that you may
know the square of which this is the root. Treat similarly the three roots
of 4 in order to find the square of which this is the root. Then multiply these
squares by each other, i.e. one of them by the other, and take the root of
this product since this is the result of the multiplicatiori of two roots of 9
by three roots of 4.

Therefore using this process you are able, casting aside error, to multiply
as many roots as you wish to join together or as many as you wish to sub-
tract from other quantities.²

PROBLEMS ILLUSTRATING THE CHAPTERS³

Says Mohammed Al-Khowarizmi: Up to this point we have set forth
the chapters on numbers which we proposed in the beginning of this work,
under six problems⁷ one for each chapter, and we also mentioned in that place
that every problem of restoration and opposition necessarily falls within the
scope of one of these six chapters. But since the explanations were some-
what involved we present and more fully explain these further problems,
by which each type is illustrated and the science is more easily elucidatedst

First problem, illustrating tlze first chapter

Divide ten into two parts in such a way that one part multiplied by
the other and the product, or result⁷ taken four times, will be equal to the
product of one part by itself.5

The method is to let x represent one part of ten, and the other 10 — x.
Therefore multiplyxby 10 — x. giving 10x — x2. Also multiply 10x — x²
by 4. as it was to be taken four times, giving 40x - 4x2 as four times the

² Rosen, op. cit, p. 31, translates this paragraph: “You proceed in this manner with all
positive or negative roots'‘; he follows with the geometrical explanation of the two problems
given in footnote 4, p. 33, and a further elucidation of the third problem of that set.

³ Scheybl adds to the statement of each problem the marginal wordy Textus, and to the expla-
nation, Minor,- also the numbering of the problems appears to be his addition.

⁴ Rosen, op. cit.y p. 35: “Or THE srx PRonrssms.

Before the chapters on computation and the several species thereos, Ι shall now introduce six
problems, as instances of the six cases treated of in the beginning of this work. I have shown
that three among these cases, in order to be solved, do not require that the roots be hzssved, and
I have also mentioned that the calculating by completion and reduction must always necessarily
lead you to one οἱ these cases. I now subjoin these problems, which will serve to bring the
subject nearer to the understanding, to render its comprehension easier, and to make the argu-
ments more perspicuous.'’
