CHAPTER VII

MANUSCRIPTS OF ROBERT OF CHEsTER’s TRANSLATION OF AL-
KHOWARIZMI’S ALGEBRA

I. THE EXTANT MANUSCRIPTS

STEINSCHNEIDER¹ was the first in recent times to call attention
to the translation of Al-Khowarizmi's algebra made by Robert
of Chester. He suggested the desirability of publishing this text,
referring to the manuscript in Vienna. To this same manuscript
Curtze² later, and independently of Steinschneider, directed atten-
tion and also suggested the desirability Of the publication of the
work. Wapplerf in 1887, found a second copy of the algebra in
a manuscript in Dresden‚ while some time later David Eugene
Smith acquired for the Columbia University Library a manu-
script from the hand of Johann Scheybl which contains a third
transcription of the algebra.

In addition to these manuscript copies Of the text, a fragment
of the translation was published by Adrien Romain of Louvain in
1599, in a work bearing the title Covmzentaire sur ίίιζξὲὀνε de Ma-
lmmed ben Musa el Cllowarezmi. Unfortunately but a fragment of
this published work had been preserved to modern times, and that
precious fragment was doubtless destroyed with other and rarer
books and manuscripts in the recent destruction of the University
at Louvain. This work of Romain‘s was mentioned in a work of
1643, published at Louvain, as being found in the Library there.
