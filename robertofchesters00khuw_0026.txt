8 INTRODUCTION

Diophantus makes the following explicit statement regarding his
intention of writing a systematic treatise on the quadratio
equation:¹

“This should be the object aimed at in framing the hypotheses of propositions,
that is to say, to reduce the equations‚ if possible, until one term is lest equal to one
term; but 1 will show you later how, in the case also where two terms are left equa]
to one term, such a problem is solved.¹’

So far as we know this promise was never fulfilled.
An equation of the first type is presented by the sixth problem
of the sixth book, and this we reproduce from Heath : 2

“ 6. To find a right-angled triangle such that the area added to one of the per-
pendiculars makes a given number.

“ Given number 7, triangle (3 x, 4x, 5 x.)

“ Therefore 6 υεἳ -†· 3 x = 7.⁷'

“ In order that this might be solved it would be necessary that (half coefficient
of .r)²-l-pr0duct of coefficient of x² and absolute term should be a square: but
(ΙὲῩ 4— 6 · 7 is not a square. Hence we must find, to replace (3, 4, 5), a right-angled
triangle such that

“ (ὲ one perpendicular)² -l— 7 times area = a square ; ’'

and the Subsequent work leads to the equation, 84 x2 4- 7 x= 7, x= 3
and the solution (6, ξ, {LA-⁵).
In the following problem (VI. 7) the value of x is given as {for

the equation
84 x² — 7 x= 7,

which equation is of the third type when the negative term is
transposed after the manner of Diophantus. The equations

63ox2÷73x=6, γεῆ,

63ox2—73x=6, γεῆ,

630x'24-81x=4‚ χεῇἷ,
and 630x2-81x=4‚ χεὲ,

occur in the next four problems (VI. 8—11). Another problem of
the third kind (IV. 39) is of especial interest because the rule is
given for solving this type :³

“To find three numbers such that the difference of the greatest and the middle
has to the differenee os the middle and the least a given ratio, and also the sum of
any two is a square.'’
