are two or three or four squares, or even more, the equation formed by
them with their roots is to be reduced to the form of one square with its
root. Further if there be less than one square, that is if a third or a fourth
or a fifth part of a square or root is proposed, this is treated in the same
manner.l

For example, five squares equal 80. Therefore one square equals the fifth
part of the number 80 which, of course, is 16.2 Or, to take another example,
half of a square equals 18. This square therefore equals 36.3 In like manner
all squares, however many, are reduced to one square, or what is less than
one is reduced to one square. The same operation must be performed
upon the numbers which accompany the squares.

CHAPTER III

Concerning rools eqztal to numbers

The following is an example of roots equal to numbers : a root is equal to
3. Therefore nine is the square of this root.4

Another example t four roots equal 20. Therefore one root of this square is
5.⁵ Still another example: half a root is equal to ten. The whole root
therefore equals 20, of which, of course, 400 represents the square.6

Theresore roots and squares and pure numbers are, as we have shown,
distinguished from one another. Whence also from these three kinds which
we have just explained, three distinct types ol equations⁷ are formed in-
volving three elements. as

A square and roots equal to numbers,
A square and numbers equal to roots‚ and
Roots and numbers equal to a square.⁸

CHAPTER IV

Concerning squares and rools equal to numbers

The following is an example of squares and roots equa] to numbers: a
square and 10 roots are equal to 39 units. The question therefore in this
type of equation is about as follows: what is the square which combined
with ten of its roots will give a sum total of 39.> The manner of solving
this type of equation is to take one-half of the roots just mentioned. Now
the roots in the problem before us are 10. Therefore take 5, which multi-
plied by itself gives 25, an amount which you add to 39, giving 64.

1 Our modern expression ¹‘ to complete the square,'’ used in algebra. originally meant to make
the coefficient of .r² equal to unity, is. make one whole square.

²5x²=80;x'-'=16. ³{.x·²=18;.r²=3o. ⁴.x·:3;.x·²=9.

⁵ 4x = 20; x = 5; ,νῖ = 25. ⁵ ὲ .1·= 103 x = 20; ,ιθ = 400. ⁷ ‘Types of equations ’ = genem.

⁸ Abu Kamil, Omar ALKhayyami, Al-Karkhi, and Leonard designate these as *composite '
types. In modern notation: ax2 -l- bx = n; ιιιιῗ -l- η = bx3 (ιι-2 = bx -1μ n.
