CHAPTER IV

THE INFLUENCE OF AL-KHOWAmZMI's ALGEBRA UPON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMArlcs

ΒΥ the translators of Arabic lore we are brought from Islarn to
Christendom. Mathematical science in Europe was more vitally
influenced by Mohammed ibn Musa than by any other writer from
the time of the Greeks to Regiomontanus (1436—1476). Through
his arithmetic, presenting the Hindu art of reckoning, he revolu-
tionized the common processes of calculation and through his
algebra he laid the foundation for modern analysis. Evidence of
the influence of the great Arab is presented by the relatively large
number of translations and adaptations of his various mathematical
works which appeared before the invention of printing. Un-
doubtedly the earliest translation of the Arabio algebra, although
not the most widely used, was that made by Robert of Chester.
Probably the version published by Libri appeared shortly afterwards
for, as we have mentioned, Gerard of Cremona employs the ter-
minology of that version in algebraic work. Roger Bacon (1214—
1294), too, has occasionl to mention the algebra, as well as the
arithmetic‚ and uses terms not found in Robert of Chester‘s version.
Bacon shows that he had but superficial familiarity with the subject,
for he made incorrect statements about the fundamental elements of
the algebra. Similarly, Vincent de Beauvais (about 1275) in his
encyclopaedic work, Speculum Principale? refers under arithmetic
to the book, qui apud Arabes mahalehe dicz'lnr. Albertus Magnus
(1193—1280) mentions the tables of ΑΙ-ΚΙ1Οκνα1-ἰῑ111ἰ.3

Even earlier than Roger Bacon is Leonard of Pisa, whose monu-
mental Liber abaci contains a chapter involving the title, Aljebra
