ADDITIONS To THE ALGEBRA 133

A notker Demonstration

Let the square ab represent 2⁴2. To the side of it apply one-half the given
number of roots and to another side of it apply the other half of the number
of the roots. Let the first addition be represented by ac and the second by
ad. To complete the square cd the square called be is lacking and the side
of this is equal to one-half the number of the roots. The reason for our
procedure (in halving the roots) is now apparent; for by multiplying the
half of the number of roots by itself we obtain the square be, and the re-
mainder is 2⁴² together with the added roots. Now since the larger square
is known, and the root of it is known, then by subtracting the root of the
square be from the root of the square ae, necessarily the root of our unknown
square remains.

The geometrical figures follow.¹

An I llustration of tlte Second Type

Let the square abed represent x2, and to its side bc apply the parallelogram
chef, which we take to be equivalent to 15 units. Then the whole rectangle
does is equivalent to 2⁴² and 15 units, thus containing 8 roots of x² (8 x).
Divide now the line df into two equal parts by the point g and erect a square
gkmd upon the side gd. Extend cb up to a point l (the point of intersection
with the upper side of the square upon gd). Mark the point of intersection of
gk with ae by the letter lz. Since db is a square, it follows by our construction
and by proposition 6 of the second book of Euclid ² that bk is a square and
further that the two parallelograms gb and bm are equal to each other.³
Further, then, by a well-known axi0m4 ga and cm are equal. Also finally,
since ga is equal to the parallelogram ge by the thirty-sixth proposition of
the first book of Euclid? it follows that cm is equal to the same parallelogram
ge. Hence subtracting 15. that is the gnomon ldlz, from the square gm,
which is 16, one is left as the area of the square bk. Since the area is known,
the side or root, which is the line lb, is also known. But the whole line lc is
known, whence it follows by subtraction of lb from lc that the line bc is
known. In this instance it is to be noted that the point g falls within the
parallelogram which is applied to the square.

The geometrica] figures follow.

² Euclid II, 6, following Heath‚ lec Tltz'rtcen Books of Enclid’s Elemcnts, p. 1. “If a straight
line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the
whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half
is equal to the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line.” In
modern algebraic notatim, (a 4- x) ,ι’ ÷ (al2)‘-' = (alz ψ .1·)².

³ By Euclid Ι, 43, following Heath‚ luc. cit„ “In any parallelogram the complements of the
parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.'’

⁴ Euclid I, 36, following Heath, loc. cil., “Parallelograms which are on equal bases and in the
same parallels are equal to one anotherff*
