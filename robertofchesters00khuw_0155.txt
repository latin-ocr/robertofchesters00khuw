you divided. According to these two methods it is possible to treat all

T lze Last Problem or Question

A man is hired to work in a vineyard 30 days for 10 pence. He works
six days. How much of the agreed price should he receive?

Explanation. It is evident that six days are one-fifth of the whole timeÍ¾
and it is also evident that the man should receive pay having the same
relation to the agreed price that the time he works bears to the whole time,
30 days. What we have proposed, is explained as follows. The month,
i.e. 30 days, represents the measure, and ten represents the price. Six
days represents the quantity, and in asking what part of the agreed price is
due to the worker you ask the cost, Therefore multiply the price 10 by
the quantity 6, which is inversely proportional to it. Divide the product
60 by the measure 30, giving 2 pence. This will be the cost, and will
represent the amount due to the worker.

This, then, is the method by which all proposed problems concerning
commercial transactions or weights and measures and all related problems
are to be solved.

Praise be to God, beside whom there is no other.
