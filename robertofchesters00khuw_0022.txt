4 INTRODUCTION

Several propositions of Euelid present geometrica] equivalents
of the solution of various types of quadratio equations, not involv-
ing negative coefficients, and further study of similar problems
appears in Euclid's Data. Of this nature are the fifth, sixth, and
eleventh propositions of the second book of the Elemenls and the
twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth of the sixth book,
and problems 84, 85, 86, and others of the Data.¹ Problem 84,
for example, reads :

“If two straight lines include a given area in a given angle,
and the excess of the greater over the less is given, then each of
them is given.’'

This corresponds to the equations:

xy=k2
x-jlel.
The two following problems (85 and 86) correspond to the
simultaneous quadratic equations:

r1y= k2,

x÷y = a,
and xy= k2,
χρ -ye Ξ a2.

The eleventh proposition of the second book of the Elements
furnishes the solution of the equation

x² -ι- ax = α2
or even more general,
,τῖ ÷ ax = b2.

As this so well illustrates the geometrical solution, it is given in
full, following Heath's Euclz'd.

BOOK II OF THE Elements (ff Emlz'd, PRoposmoN 11

“ To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and
one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.

“ Let AB be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut AB so that the
rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on
the remaining segment.

of lee Elements t3f Euclz'd by Simson. The numbering of the problems is slightly differ-
ent in the two versions.
