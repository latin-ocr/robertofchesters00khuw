CHAPTER VI

PREFACE AND AnnirloNs FOUND IN THE ARABIC TEXT oF
AL-KHOWARIZMI'S ALGEBRA

THE Arabic text of Al-Khowarizmi's algebra published by Rosen
contains an author's preface which is not found either in the trans-
lation published by Libri, or in that by Robert of Chester. As
this reveals his conception of the purpose of the algebra‚ as well
as some of the causes which led him to undertake the work, we
present it here in the translation by Rosen.1 Such prefaces in
Arabic works usually, just as this one, contained invocations to
the Deity and to Mohammed his prophet: in consequence the
Christian translators‚ who were commonly connected with the
Church, were wont to leave them out. A summary of the sections
in the Arabic text which appear in neither of the Latin transla-
tions is also given since the Arabic-English work by Rosen is not
widely available‚ and since these additions show that Al-Kho-
warizmi had grasped the possibility of the application o't' the algebra
to geometry and trigonometry. This application is frequently
neglected to-day by teachers of elementary algebra.

THE AL'THOR’S PREFACE

“ In the Name os God, gracious and merciful ἱ '’

“This work was written by Mohammed ben Musa, of Khowarezm. He corn-
mences it thus:

“ Praised be God for his bounty towards those who deserve it by their virtuous
acts: in performing which, as by him prescribed to his adoring creatures, we ex-
press our thanks, and render ourselves worthy of the continuance (of his mercy), and
preserve ourselves from change ς acknowledging his might, bending before his
power, and revering his greatness Ι He sent Mohamrned (on whom may the bless-
ing of God repose l) with the mission of a prophet, long after any messenger from
above had appeared, when justice had fallen into neglect, and when the true way of
life was sought for in vain. Through him he cured of blindness, and saved through
him from perdition, and increased through him what before was small, and collected
through him what before was scattered. Praised be God our Lord ἔ and may his
glory increase, and may all his names be hallowed — besides whom there is no God 3
and may his benediction rest on Mohammed the prophet and on his descendants !
