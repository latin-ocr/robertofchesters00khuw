Hence we take half of ten and multiply this by itself. We then add the
whole product of the multiplicatiori to 39, that the drawing of the larger
square G H may be completed ; ¹ for the lack of the four corners rendered
incomplete the drawing of the whole of this square. Now it is evident
that the fourth part of any number multiplied by itself and then multi-
plied by four gives the same number as half of the number multiplied
by itself.² Therefore if half of the roots is multiplied by itself, the sum
total of this multiplication will wipe out, equal or cancel ³ the multiplicatiori
of the fourth part by itself and then by four.

Another method4 also of demonstrating the same is given in this manner:
to the square α b representing the square of the unknown we add ten roots
and then take half of these roots, giving 5. From this
we construet two areas added to two sides of the square
figure a b. These again are called α g and b d. The
breadth of each is equal to the breadth of one side of
the square α b and each length is equal to 5. We
have now to complete the square by the product of 5
and 5. which, representing the half of the roots, we

ab square, representing x²„5 equals 39. Furthermore it is

evident that the area of the larger or whole square is
formed by the addition of the product of 5 by 5. This

manuscript. The sum total is 64. Now we take the square root of
this, representing one side of the larger square and then we subtract
from it the equal of that which we added, namely 5. Three remains,

¹ This corresponds to our algebraic process of completing the square. The correspondence
of the geometrical procedure to the terminology and the methods employed in algebra makes it
highly desirable to present the geometrical and algebraical discussions together to students ol
elementary mathematics.

⁴¹ A method slightly different from either of these is given by Abu Kamil and also in the
Boncompagni version of Al-Khowarizmi's algebra, ascribed to Gerard of Cremona. This con-

dimension is the same as that οἱ the square. The two together represent x² -1- on, or 39. Bi-

side of the original square, (x -l- 5)‘-'‚ equals the whole rectangle (39) plus the square 25 of half
the side 10. The rest of the demonstration is similar to that here given.
