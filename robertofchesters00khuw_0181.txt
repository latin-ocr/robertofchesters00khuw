ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 151

Eighth question

Ι divided 10 into two parts, and each being multiplied by itself, I sub-
tracted the smaller from the larger, and 40 remained. The question is
as to the parts? The answer in accordance with the rule is 7 and 3.

Rule. Multiply x by x, and you obtain x2. Then multiply also 10 — x
by 10 — x and you obtain 100 units -4— x² — 20 x. Subtract, therefore, x²
from 100 -1- x² — 20 x, and you have 100 — 20 x, which equals 40 units.
By restoration say, then, that 100 units are equal to 4ο unjts and 20 x.
Then by subtracting 40 from 100 it is plain that 60 units are equal to 20 x,
and hence 3 units to one x. Three is one part; hence 7 is the other.

N intlz question

I divided 10 into two parts, and multiplied each part by itself3 then I
added these products together, and the difference between these two, be-
fore each was multiplied by itself, and the result was 54. The question
is stated. The answer in accordance with the rule Is 6 and 4.

Rule. Multiply x by x, and also 10 — x by 10 — x; add the products and
you obtain 100 units -Ι- 2 ,1⁴² — 20 x. Since the excess of one part over the
other, or the difference of the parts, is 10 — 2 x, when this excess is added
we shall have 110 units -ὶ- 2 x² — 22 x as the sum total, which equals 54
unjtS. Say therefore, by adding the 22 x, that 110 units ψ 2 x² equals 54
um'ts -lss 22 x. Then by reduction to one square, you say that 5 5 units 4- x²
equal 27 um'ts and 11 x. By subtracting 27 from 55, you say that x2 ψ 28
um'ts equals 11 x. Treat this by the chapter in which squares and num-
bers equal roots‚ and it will be plain that one part is 6, and the other 4.

T entlt question

I divided ten into two parts, and I divided each of these by the other;
the sum of the two quotientS, that is to say, the result, is two and one-sixth.
The question is stated. The answer in accordance with the rule is 4 and 6.

Rule. The sum of the products of each (of the parts) multiplied by
itself is equal to the product of the one by the other when tlu's product is
multiplied by the sum of the quotients of each of the divisions, which in
this case is 23. Hence you inultiply 10 — x by itself, and x by x, obtain-
ing 100 -ι- 2 ‚r2 — 20 x. This total is equal to the product of x by 10 — x,
multiplied by 24} But the product of x by 10 — x gives 10 ,r — x2‚ which
being multiplied by 21¹3 there results 21 x ἦ· ξ x — 2} „1⁴² equal to 100 units
-Ι- 2 x2 — 20 x. By restoration, then, of the squares and the roots, 41 a· 4—
ξ x are obtained equal to 100 units 4- 4 „r2 -μ ὲ ,r². Reduce the whole then
to one square in the following manner ε If a square is supposed to be 6,
then 43¹5> squares would be 25 ; of this, one squarey namely ὁ, is ἑ and ὲ of ξ.
Take therefore of everything which you have ἑ and ὲ of ὲ, and it wssl

be plain that 10 x is equal to x² ψ 24 units. Proceed then by that chap-
