I multiply x 4- 2 units by ᾗ, representing the quotient.l This gives {x
and a unit equal to x. On account of the one-half x Ι take one-half x from
both sides, leaving a unit equal to ὲκ. Ι double this, giving two units,
which equal the unknown. Whence four is the other.

S ixtlz Problem

Ι multiply a square by its root in such a way that the product equals three
similar squares.²

Explanation. From what is given it follows that when you multiply
the root by one-third of the square, the total gives the square.³ Therefore
3 represents the root of this square, and 9 the square.

Seventlz Problem

I multiply three roots of a square by four of its roots in such away that the
sum total of the multiplication will equal the same square and 44 units.⁴²

Explanation. Multiplying four roots of a square by three of its roots,
we have twelve squares, which are equal to one square and 44 units.5 Take
therefore the one square from the 12 squares, leaving 11 squares equal to
44. Hence one square equals 4.

Eiglztlz Problem

I multiply four roots of a square by five roots of the same square in such
a way that the sum total of the multiplication will equal double the square
and 36 units.⁶

Explanation. I multiply four roots of a square by five of its roots and
I have as a product 20 squareS, which are equal to 2 squares and 36 units.
Therefore Ι take the two squares from the 20 squares, leaving 18 squares
equa] to 36 units. I divide 36 by 18, and obtain 2, which represents the
square.⁷

Al-Khowarizmi carefully avoids the term for the cube of the unknown, with which he was
certainly familiar, for Diophantus and other Greek writers employed the term. His continuator,
Abu Kamil, discussed not only cubics which, like this one, are reducible immediately (to equa-
tions of lower degree), but also equations in quadratic form. However, systematic discussion
of the general cubic was first attempted by Omar Khayyam.
