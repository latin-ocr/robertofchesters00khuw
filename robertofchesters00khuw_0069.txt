PREFACE AND ADDITIONS FOUND IN THE ARABIC TEXT 47

given for the area of a square and triangle. Three formulas are
given for the circumference of a circle and the writer evidently
recognizes them all as approximations- The formulas are:

(1) c=3}d‚
(2) c=xsffid2
(3) [3ξὲξὲ

The area of a circle is given as A=d2—}d2—{ ofssd‘z Other
simple areas and volumes are discussed. Application of the
algebra is found in two problems. One of these deals with finding
the altitude of a triangle of which the sides are given; the other
with inscribing a square in a given triangle.

As the problems, on finding the altitude of a triangle‚ being
given the lengths of the sides, and on inscribing in an isosceles
triangle a square, show that Al-Khowarizmi had an appreciation
of the possibilities of the algebra, Ι present one of the pmblems,
following Rosen’s translation.

“ If some one says: ‘There is a triangular piece of land, two of its sides having
10 yards each, and the basis 12 3 what must be the length osone side of a quadrate
situated within such a triangle?’ the solution is this. At first you ascertain the
height of the triangle, by multiplying the moiety of the basis, (which is six) by itself,
and subtracting the product, which is thirty-six, from one of the two short sides
multiplied by itsels, which is one-hundred; the remainder is sixty-sour3 take the
root from this3 it is eight. This is the height of the triangle. Its area is, therefore,
forty-eight yards : such being the product of the height multiplied by the moiety of
the basis, which is six. Now we assume that one side of the quadrate inquired sor
is thing. We multiply it by itsels; thus it becomes a square, which we keep in mind.
We know that there must remain two triangles on the two sides of the quadram, and
one above it. The two triangles on both sides of it are equal to each other: both
having the same height and being rectangular. You find their area by multiplying
thing by six less half a thing, which gives six things less half a square. This is the
area of both the triangles on the two sides of the quadrate together. The area of
the upper triangle will be found by multiplying
eight less thing, which is the height, by half
one thing. The product is four things less
half a square. This altogether is equal to No( φο

the area of the quadrate plus that of the three
triangles: or, ten things are equal to sorty-

eight, which is the area of the great triangle. *ο
One thing from this is four yards and four—

fifths os a yard 3 and this is the length os any s

side of the quadrate. Here is the figure: '³ 3} 4} 3}
