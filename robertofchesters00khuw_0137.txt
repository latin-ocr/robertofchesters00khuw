obtain thus the quantityl which was divided. And as in this problem the
quotient is 4 and the divisor is given as x, you multiply 4 by x, giving 4x for
the quantity which was divided⁷ io. equal to 10 — x. Therefore complete
10 - x by adding x to 4x, giving 10 equal to 5x. Whence it follows that
x is 2. Thus this problem has led you to the third of the six chapters in
which we treated the type, roots equal to numbers.

Fourth problem, illustrating the ¹fourth chapter

Multiplyssxand one unit by ὲ xand one unit so as to give as the product 20.²

Explanation. You multiply {x by ix, giving ὲ of ὲκῗ, and a unit mul-
tiplied by {x gives {x to be added. Similarly {x multiplied by a unit gives
{x and then a unit by a unit gives a unit. Then this multiplication
amounts to ὲ of ὲκῖ, and {x and {x and one a unit, equal to 20 units.
You subtract one unit from 20 units, giving 19 units equal to ὲ of ÷x²
together with {x and {aa Now then you complete the square,3 i.e. you
multiply throughout by 12. This gives x2 and 7x equal to 228. Then
halve the roots, ie. divide them equally, and multiply one—half by itself‚
giving 12} You add this to 228, and you will have 240{. From the root
of this, 15}v subtract 33, leaving 12 as the root of the square. Now then
this problem has led you to the fourth of the six chapters in which we
treated the type, a square and roots equal to numbers.

Fisth problem, illustrating the fisth chapter

Ι divide ten into two parts in such a way that the sum of the products
obtained by multiplying each part by itself is equal to 58.4

¹ Robert of Chester employs substantia here in the non-technical sense of “ substance ’¹ or “quan-
tity.’' So also census in the Libri version and mal in the Arabic version are used with the same
significance. This was a common usage of Arabic writers. Abu Kamil followed this practice,
on occasion, and Leonard of Pisa, who drew extensively from Abu Kamil. copied this peculiarity
from the Arabs: see scritti di Leonardo Pisana, Vol. Ι, p. 422. and my article, The Algebra os
Abu Kamil Shoja‘ bon Asiam, Bibliotheca Mathematica, third series, Vol. XII (1912—1913)‚p. 53.
In particular, also, consus appears in this sense in the Liber augmenti et diminutionis voralus nu-
meratio divinationis, es co quod sopientes Indi posuerunt, quemv Abraham compilavit et secundum
librum qui Indorum dictus est composuit, published by Libri, Histoire des πίονα-ες mathematiques en
Italic, Vol. Ι, Paris, 1838, pp. 304—371. This work is probably by Abraham ibn Esra.

³ The present usage of the expression “to complete the square'' is quite different from that of
our text. Here it means, of course, to make the coefficient of x² unity and this also corresponds
to the operation termed by the Arabs, algebra, as opposed to the operation of almuqabala‚·
see the article al-Djabr uva-’l-Mulqabala by Professor H. Suter in The Encyclopedia os Islam,
Vol. I (Leyden, 1913), pp. 989-990.

⁴x² ÷(10-x)²= 583 2x2- 20x ÷100= 58; 2x²÷42= 20x; x²÷21 = 102⁶, which is a
problem that appears earlier in the text.
