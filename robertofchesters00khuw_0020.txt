2 INTRODUCTION

tian document presents not only first degree equations together
with symbols for the unknown quantity and for the operations of
addition and subtraction, but also shows traces of a study of
simultaneous linear equations some two thousand years before the
Christian Era. Later, but still before the golden age of Greek
mathematics, the quadratic equation appears in Egypt. The
problems found involve simultaneous quadratio equations, thus: 1

“Another example of the distribution of a given area into
squares. If you are told to distribute 100 square ells (units of
area) over two squares so that the side of one shall be Ξ of the
side of the other: please give me each of the unknowns.’‘ The
solution follows by assuming the side of one square to be unity,
and the other {- The sum of these areas is ἒξ, of which the root
is {a The root of 100 is 103 10, then, is to the required side as ἓ
is to 1, whence one side is 8 and the other 6. The algebraical
equivalent of this geometrica] problem is. evidently,

,τῖ’ -1- y‘-' = 100,
y=ffx
Noteworthy also is the fact that a symbol for square root occurs
in the discussion of these problems.

The solution above leads to the number relation, 62÷82= 10²,
which connects directly with the simpler form, 32-1-42Ξ 52, and to
the same relation other problems of this kind reduce.2 This
makes connection, of course, with the so-called Pythagorean theo-
rem that the sum of the squares on the sides of a right triangle
equals the square on the hypotenuse. Even though the Egyp-
tians had no logical proof for this proposition, their familiarity
with it is well established. In the time of Plato, and for some
centuries afterwards, the Egyptians were famed as surveyors‚ and
the principle stated seems to have been applied by them in laying
out right angles by means of a long rope knotted at equal inter-
vals. Two pegs situated three units apart are set out along the
line to which it is desired to draw a perpendicular. From one peg
