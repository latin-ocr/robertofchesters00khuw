CHAPTER Ι

ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS BEFORE AL-KHOWAszI

ARABIC contributions to science have, in the past, been sorne-
what neglected by historians. More recent studies are recogniz-
ing our indebtedness to Mohammedan scholars, who kept the
embers of learning aglow while Europe was in the darkness of
the Middle Ages. Much of our knowledge of Greek mathematics
comes to us from Arabic sources; the early Latin versions were
frequently based upon Arabic texts rather than the Greek origi-
nals. Similarly‚ Hindu arithmetic and astronomy were trans-
rnitted to Europe by Islain. The services of the Arabs to science
were not limited to the preservation and transmission of the
learning of other nations. They rnade independent contributions
in many fields.

Among these achievements is the Arabic algebra of Al-Khow-
arizrni, which for centuries enjoyed wide popularity in the origi-
nal, and for further centuries extended its popularity through
translations and adaptations. A study of the content of this
work is an excursion into mediaeval thought. By a study of the
text in a form as nearly like the original as possible, we discover
the reason for its long-continued appeal to the Occidental as well
as the Oriental mind, its interest for the Englishman. the Ger-
man, and the Italian, as well as for the Arab. Even to-day
teachers of elementary mathematics may find this book fruitful
in suggestion: the geometric solutions of quadratic equations
presented by the Arabic writer rnore than a thousand years ago
may be used with profit in our classroorns.

Sitnple equations of the first degree in one unknown, of the
type ax=b, are found in the oldest mathematical text-book which
we possess, the Ahmes papyrus of about 1700 B.c., which was
published with a German translation by Eisenlohr.l This Egyp-
