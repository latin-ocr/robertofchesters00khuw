AL—KHOWARIZMI AND HIS TREATISE ΟΝ ALGEBRA 21

simple general rules for the solution of equations. A separate
work on the same subject by Ibn al-Banna is included among the
Arabic manuscripts in Cairo, In modern times Arabs have used
lithograph copies of an arithmetic and algebra by Mohammed
ibn al-Hosein‚ Beha al-din al-‘Amili (Belia eddim), who died in
1622. Two editions ¹ with a translation into the Persian language
and commentary were published in the nineteenth century.
Beha ed-din continues the use of some of Al—Khowarizmi's
problems as well as the six types of quadratics.

Greek influence on Arabic geometry is revealed by the order
of the letters employed on the geometrical figures. These letters
follow the natural Greek order and not the Arabic order. The
same is true of the order of the letters in the geometrical figures
used by Al-Khowarizmi for verification of his solutions of
quadratio equations. However, the somewhat ingenious hypothe-
sis put forth by Cant0r2 that this fact shows that these demon-
strations are from Greek sources is hardly tenable. The Arabs
were much more familiar with and grounded in Euclid than are
mathematicians to-day, and it was entirely natural in constructing
new figures that they should follow the order of lettering to which
they had grown accustomed in their study of Euclid. Until
further and more definite historical evidence to the contrary is
brought to light we must regard Al-Khowarizmi as the first to
bring out sharply the parallelisrn between the analytical and
geometrica] solutions of quadratio equations.

The Arabic students of algebra included poets, philosophers
and perhaps even kings. Omar Khayyam, whom we have men-
tioned among the writers on the subject, was too excellent
a mathematician and too true a poet to woo the muse of algebra
in verse. But in the library of the Escurial at Madrid there is
preserved a poem treating of algebra, written by a native of
Granada, Mohammed al-Qasim. Needless to say, the content,
adapted to the exigencies of verse, does not compare with the
