24 INTRODUCTION

disallinus. The probability is that the De divisione philosophiae
is their joint production.¹ A somewhat similar method was pur-
sued at first by Gerard of Cremona, collaborating with an Arab
named Galippus or Galib.·2

Adelard of Bath translated the astronomical tables which we
have mentioned and possibly another astronomical work by
Al-Khowarizrni.³ His life is typical ot the lite of learned men
of that period. Although born in England, he evidently went to
France at an early age. There he studied at Tours and delivered
lectures in Laon. At least seven years of his life were spent in
study and trave] in the East. Tarsus, Antioch‚ and Salerno are
mentioned by him as cities which he visited. While no direct
evidence is known that he studied in Spain, yet many of his
works are based on Arabic documents transmitted to Europe
through the Spanish schools at Toledo and Segovia. Learning
was quite as international in that time as to-day.

Gerard of Cremona, too, desiring to find the works of Ptolemy,
journeyed to Spain and there took up the study of the Arabic
language in order to understand the Arabic version of Ptolemy,
with the result that he devoted his life to translations from the
Arabic. Included in an early list⁴ of his translations is the alge-
bra of Al-Khowarizmi, and it seems probable that the Latin
version published by Libri ⁵ is from his hand. However, Boncom—
pagni in his discussion of the life and works of Gerard of Cre-
mona has published another mediaeval adaptation of the algebra
which is ascribed to Gerard. The words res and census for the
unknown and its square, and also the title alz'abre et almuclzabala,
are used by Gerard in his translation of Ababucri‘s Book of tlze
measurement of tlte earth and of solitis, as yet in manuscript.⁶
Plato of Tivoli was also doubtless familiar with Mohammed ibn
