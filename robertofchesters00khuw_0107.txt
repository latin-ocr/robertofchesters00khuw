to the units, it follows that a root of the square will be the same as the half
of the roots which accompany the square, without either addition or dim-
inution.¹ Whenever a problem is proposed that involves two squares, or
more or less than a single square, reduce to one square just as we have
indicated in the first chapter.

CHAPTER VI

C oncerning roots and numbers equal to α square

An example of this type is proposed as follows: three roots and the
number four are equal to a square.2 The rule for the investigation of this
kind of problem is, you see, that you take half of the roots, giving one and
one-half; this you multiply by itsels. producing οὲ. ΤΟ 2} add 4, giving
ὑὲ, of which you then take the square root, that is. 2}— To 2} you now add
the half of the roots, or Ῑὲ, giving 4, which indicates one root of the square.
Then 16 completes the square.³ Now also whatever is proposed to you
either more or less than a square, reduce to one square.

Now of the types of equations which we mentioned in the beginning of
this book, the first three are such that the roots are not halved, while in

the following or remaining threey the roots are halved, as appears above.

GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATIONS

We have said enough. says Al-Khowarizrni‚ so far as numbers are
concerned, about the six types of equations. Nowy however, it is necessary
that we should demonstrate geometrically the truth a
of the same problems which we have explained in
numbers. Thereiore our first proposition is this,
that a square and 10 roots equal 39 units.

The proof is that we construct a square of un-
known sides, and let this square figure represent the
square (second power of the unknown) which together b
with its root you wish to find. Let the square, FIG- 1r—Thisfigure ap-

then, be a b, of which any side represents one root. pffirgiamssnhnscssetcffi
