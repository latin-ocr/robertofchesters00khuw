CHAPTER V

THE ARABIC TExT AND THE TRANSLATIONS or AL-KnowAmzm‘s
ALGEBRA

THE Arabic text of Al-Khowarizmi's algebra, together with an
English translation, was published by Frederick Rosen in 1831.
This excellentl work is unfortunately out of print, and so is not
available to most students of mathematics. The translation is
made with care and intelligence, but not literally. Thus the
Arabic invocation to the Deity is frequently omitted, just as it
often is by modern translators.

The translation of the Algebra into Latin was made not only
by Robert of Chester‚ but also, as we have indicated, by some
other student of Arabic science who lived about the same time as
Robert. This Latin version, as found in two Paris manuscripts,
was published by Libri ;2 Bjornbo believed that he had established ³
this to be the work of Gerard of Cremona, which indeed is probable.
A list of the numerous translations due to Gerard was made soon
after Gerard's death by some friend and admirer, and the list was
published by Boncompagni.4 Included among the titles is the
algebra‚ Liber alclzoarz'smz' de iebra ct almucabnla traclatus l.
However, the question is somewhat complicated by the fact that a
mediaeval adaptation of the algebra which was published by Bon-
compagni⁵ bears the name of Gerard of Cremona. The textos
this version does not follow the Arabic at all closely, and there is
little reason for considering it as a direct translation. Probably
the meaning of the title*5 is that the text of this version is based
upon Gerard’s translation.

¹ Portions of the Arabic text and translation have been examined by Professor
W. H. VVorrell, to whose courtesy 1 am indebted for the information about the character
os the translation.
