52 INTRODUCTION

mediately follows concerns arithmetic proper, and the remainder
of the material in the Ms. is also mathematical.

The Vienna Ms. (V) is assigned in the catalogue of Mss. of the
Vienna library to the fourteenth century, and the character of the
writing agrees with this dating. In the fifteenth century Peur-
bach and Regiornontanus, diligent students of Arabic mathe-
matics, were connected with the University of Vienna, which was
then a mathematical centre. This copy itself may have been
acquired by Regiornontanus for the library at Vienna; other Mss.
from the hand of Regiomontanus are preserved in Vienna.

The Dresden Codex C. 80 (D) was written in the latter part of
the fifteenth century. Wappler¹ states that Johann Widmann
of Eger, whose activity at the University of Leipzig falls at the
end of the fifteenth century, transcribed certain portions of the
Dresden Codex, but the writer of our text is not known. Adam
Riese, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, also used this
Ms. The algebra of our text begins on folio 340² and terminates
in the middle of folio 348b; the section relating to commercial
problems is not found in its proper place, but appears in the
Ms. on folio 301². For the collation of this latter section I have
used the printed text, mentioned above, by VVappler.

an incornplete manuscript of the work. The necessary additions
