38 INTRODUCTION

have lectured on algebra in the university at Leipzig, and the fee
for the course was set extraordinarily high, being two florins.l
Widmann was in possession of the Dresden manuscript,2 which
contains Robert of Chester's version of the algebra of Al-Kho-
warizmi, and himself added certain algebraic problems to another
part of ‘che same manuscript dealing with algebra. The Arab
Al-Kalasacli.³ contemporary with Widmann, wrote also on similar
topics, and although he does not cite Al-Khowarizmi, yet he
continues the old order of the six types of quadratio equations.

Adam Riese wrote in 1524 a work on algebra entitled‚ Die
Coss, which contains, as we have noted, the problem

x²÷21=1ox.

Riese refers to “that most celebrated Arabic master Algebra‚
learned in number, whose like in computation there never was,
and hardly will any one exceed him.'' He refers also to the
book, “named gebra and almucabola,‘' by this mythical Algebra.
A reference to Algum is also doubtless to Al-Khowarizmi. Sev-
eral contemporaries, students of the Coss are mentioned⁴³ by Adam
Riese, and included among these is Grammateus‚⁵ also known as
Schreiber or Scriptor, to whom is credited the first algebra in
print in the German language. Interesting is Riese’s note that
Hans Conrad‚ to whom he frequently refers, paid the mathema-
tician Andreas Alexander one florin in gold, to be taught how to
solve certain types of problems by the Coss. This title is from
the Italian cosa (Latin res, Arabic slzai) and connects with the
use by Al-Khowarizmi‚ and subsequent Arabs, of the word slzai,
meaning thing, for the first power of the unknown. For centuries
the title continued in circulation in Germany, and even in English
appeared in the form, “the arte of cosslike nombers.” ⁶

whom is credited the first printed work on algebra, was evidently
