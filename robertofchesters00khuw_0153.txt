is indicated by the question as to the quantity. The rule of this kind of
problem is to consider the three quantities which are given or known, of
which two are always found to be inversely proportional to each other.
These two are to be multiplied one by the other and the product of the mul-
tiplication is to be divided by the third number, likewise known, which is
inversely proportional to the unknown. Now the quotient os this division
will be the number which is sought, and it is inversely proportional to the
number by which you divide. But lest some error be made in this type
of problem we give an example of it.l

A Problem os the F irst Type

Ten for six, how many for four?

Observe now in what manner the given numbers are related, according to
what we have said. For when you say ‘⁴ ten,” you give the measure, and when
you say “for six,'' you state the price. When you ask, “how much ? '' you
give the unknown, called Almuhen or MaguL and saying “for four,'' you
mention the cost. You note further that three of these, that is, 10, 6, and
4, are known and definite numbers, and the question is concerning the
fourth or unknown number. If now you take account of the rule given, you
multiply the first by the last, that is, 10 by 4, for they are the known and
definite numbers which are inversely proportional to each other. It is
necessary to divide the product, that is, 40, by the other known and definite
number, that is, the measure, which is 6. This gives 6} designating the
unknown number. This number is inversely proportional to the number
six, which in Arabic is called Alszarar.

A Problem of llze Second Type

An example of the second type of such problems is given by the question,
“ten for eight, what is the cost of four ? ''

Ten now is the measure which is inversely proportional to the unknown
cost, and eight designates the price which is inversely proportional to the
quantity, 4. Theret'ore multiply one of the two known and inversely pro—
portional numbers by the other, that is, 4 by 8, and you will have 32. Divide
32 by the third known number, 10, which is the measure. This gives 3},
designating the cost which is inversely proportional to the number by which

¹ As we have noted in the introduction, page 44, this paragraph is not carefully translated by
Robert of Chester, and he added the last sentence. The corresponding passage in the Libri ver-
sion (op. cit„ pp. 268e260) is entitled, Capitulum conventionum ncgociatorum, and begins as fol-
lows: Scias quod conventiones negotiationis hominum, que sunt de emptione et venditione et
cambitione et conductione et ceteris rebus, sunt secundum duos modos, curn quattuor numeris
quibus interrogator loquitur.

Leonard of Pisa (Liber abbaci. p. 2 and p. 83) follows somewhat the terminology of this ver-
sion in his discussion. The title (p. 2) is given: Dc emptione et venditione rerum uenalium ct
similium. The section opens (p. 83), as follows: ‘In omnibus itaque negotiationibus quattuor
numeri proportionales semper reperiuntur, ex quibus tres sunt noti, reliquus uero est ignotus.'
