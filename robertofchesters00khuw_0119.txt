left equa] to l n. Further since e d equals n o, as they measure the breadth
of the same area, therefore n 0 equals l n. Now as from the above demon-
stration k lis not unequal to n s, it follows that the area comprehended by
k l and l n equals the area included by the lines ns and n ο. m
Therefore the area k n equals the area n c. The area e c
amounts to the number four which we added to the three ῃ ⁰ h
roots, and it is evident that the two areas e o and kn are

equal in quantity to the one area e c, containing four in

number. It is clear to us that the square g 0 consists of the

product of one-half of the roots, zle. Ιὲ, by itself‚ with the

addition of the two areas e 0 and k n. Thus the sum total F F

of this square is 6} and the root of it is given by 23, which I‘iheu' {exim
is contained by the side dg. We have left of the side of manuscript.¹
the first square, which is the area a b, representing 1⁵², the half of the roots
amounting to 1} which is the side g α. The line d g is a side of the square
g 0y containing the product of one-half of the roots by itself with the addi-
tion of four, as we have said. This total amounts to ὑὲ. We add the root
of this, Ξὲ, to the line g α which is one—half of the three roots⁷ amounting
to Ῑὲ. Hence this sum total reaches four, which is the line α d. This is
the root of x² and also further of the square α c. The whole of x² is finally
16. This is what we desired to explain.

We have now explained these things concisely by geometry in order that
what is necessary for an understanding of this branch of study might be
made easier. The things which with some difficulty are conceived of by the
eye of the mind are made clear by geometrical figures.²

Posmviss AND NEGATIVES

And I found, says Mohammed Al-Khowarizmi, that all problems of resto-
ration and opposition are included in the six Chapters which we have set
forth in the beginning of this book.³

¹ The writer of the Vienna manuscript took no pains to make the proportions of his figures
correct. Thus in this figure a b d g is intended to represent a square, while e is supposed to be
the middle point of the line Ιι g. Further ο c is to be a square and likewise 6 m, and also the
rectangle n t is intended to be equal to the rectangle z m, Moreover the proof in the Vienna
manuscript is not consistent with the lettering of the figure, showing that the copyist did not
succeed in following closely the argument of the text. similarly the figures in the Boncompagni
version do not have the correct proportions,

For the proof based directly on Euclid ΙΙ. 6, see page 133. The Boncompagni version and
Abu Kamil make explicit reference to the propositions of Euclid.

² This paragraph is not found in either the Libri or the Arabic versions; nor in the Boncom-
pagni text.

³ The evident meaning of this passage is that all problems leading to equations of the first or
second degree can be solved by the methods set forth in the preceding text.
