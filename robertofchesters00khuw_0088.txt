sity at Vienna when Scheybl was a student there. Further‚ we
know that the Dresden Codex was used by Johann Widmann of
Eger towards the end of the fifteenth century when Widmann was
lecturing on algebra in the University of Leipzig, and a little
later this same manuscript was used by Adam Riese. Although
Scheybl was connected as teacher and student with the Univer-
sity of Tiibingen, his first work1 was published at Leipzig.
Scheybl may have been familiar, then, with both of our manu-
scripts, or with the parent. Scheybl's manuscript was prepared
with care for the printer, and the few omissions do not throw any
light upon his source.

Another difficulty in connection with the Scheybl text is the
fact that he took many liberties with the text. I have noted in
many places where Scheybl wrote the word which is given in the
Vienna and Dresden Mss.‚ and then deleted to substitute a word
of his own. Thus, in the text of page 78‚line 4, the words aequa-
lium and scilicet both, though at first written, were crossed out by
Scheybl‚ and on page 80 similar deleted words in the text of lines
3, 8, and 17 correspond also to words in the Vienna and Dresden
Mss. In the text of page 76, line 15, of page 82, line 15, and page
100, line 19, the deleted word follows the Dresden ΜΞ. and not the
Vienna, while the reverse is true in the text of page 82, line 8, and
page 102, line 12. The agreements of Scheybl's Ms. with the
Vienna, as opposed to the Dresden readings, number about 125,
whereas, the reverse agreements with the Dresden Ms. number
about 70; these include phrases as well as single words. Notably,
the two concluding paragraphs of the Vienna Ms. with the date
and place of the translation, appear in Scheybl's Ms. and not in
the Dresden Ms.

In the text of page 68‚1ine 6. after collzgritur Scheybl omits a
passage of some fifty letters ending in com'ungilur; while this may
be an omission from like to like, yet it may also have been deliber—
ately left out as the statement is a repetition, found in the Arabic,
of a passage which precedes (lines 1—2). In the text of page 72,
line 6, fuerint ut sunt due uel 3s uel plures seu pauciores fuerint
Scheybl passes from one fuerint to the second, an omission of
some 36 letters. The omission of about ninety letters after exten-
