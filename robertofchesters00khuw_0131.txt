i.e. one-half of 3. For Ιὲ taken twice gives 3.¹ You proceed then in the
same manner with such multiplications with all roots, whether they are
integral or fractional.

Metlzod os dividing

If, moreover, you wish to divide the root of 9 by the root of 4, you divide
9 by 4, giving ἡ, and the root of this, which is finally ἦ, completes the
division.²

If you wish to perform the reciprocal division, isse. divide the root of 4
by the root of 9, divide 4 by 9, giving 3 of a unit, and take the root of this,
i.e. ξ. This is. of course, the result of the division.3

Another metlzod os division

You may desire to divide the root of 9 by the root of 4, without dividing
the square by the square.⁴ Double or gather up the root of 9 as many times
as desired and of the resulting number you find the root. This number di-
vide by4 or by any other number by which you wished to divide the first
root; for in this way the root of it will be found. You proceed then in like
manner if you wish to divide the root of 9 by 3 or 4 or less, or by ὲ 01 lessy
or by anything else; with all of these the rule is the same. Follow then
the rule which we have explained and so you will find the result, if God will.

Similur multiplicatz'ons explained by things, or roots, and numbers

Now if you wish to multiply the root of 9 by the root of 4, multiply 9 by 4,
giving 36. Take the root of this. ie. 6. This is the product of the root of
9 multiplied by the root of 4. Likewise if you wish to multiply the root of
5 by the root of 10, you multiply 5 by 10 giving 50.5 The root of this is
the desired product.

⁴¹ There seems to be something incorrect about Robert's translation. Probably this should be
as in the Arabic, according to Rosen, op. sit.. p. 30: *‘ If you wish to divide twice the root of 9 by
the root of 4, or of any other square, you double the root of nine in the manner above shown
to you in the chapter on Multiplication‚ and you divide the product by four, or by any number
whateven You perform this in the way pointed out.

In like manner, if you wish to divide three roots of nine. or more, or one<half or any mul-
tiple or sub-multiple of the root of nine, the rule is always the same: follow it, the result
will be right.”

Rosen here follows the custom of modern translators of Arabic in leaving out the reference to
the Deity which is actually given in the Arabic text.
