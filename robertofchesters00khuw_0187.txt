ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 157

Seventeenth question

Ι divided a drachma and one-half between a man and a part of a man, and
to the man there fell the double of that which fell to the part (of a man).
The question is, how large was the part? The answer is ὲ.

Rule. A man and part of a man is the same as 1 -ί- x. Hence 1} is divided
by 1 ἢ- x, giving 2 x. Then multiply 2 x by 1 -Ι- x, giving 2 x²-†— 2 x, which
is equal to 1}- Therefore by reduction to one square, say that x² -†— x is
equal to ἓ of a unit. Operate now by the chapter in which squares and roots
equal number, multiplying one-half of the roots by itself‚ obtaining ὲ ; this
added to Ξ makes 1, of which the root is 1 ; from this subtract the half of the

number of the roots, giving ὲ, the value of the part that is sought.

Eiglzteentlz question

Ι divided a drachma among some men, and each one obtained an unknown
amount (x); I then added one man to the group and again Ι divided a
drachma among thern ; to each man there now fell ἐ drachma less than before.
The question is, how many men were there? The answer is 2.

Rule. In considering this problem you multiply the first number of men
by the decrease ; then you multiply the product by the number of men -l- 1,
and the quantity will be obtained. However you should note that this is not
a general rule ; you have ὲχῖ -f- ἐπὶ which is equal to 1. Hence by com-
pleting the quantity you obtain x² ψ x equal to 6 units. Operate there-
fore by the chapter in which squares and roots equal numbers. Multiply-
ing one-half of the roots by itself, ἑ is obtained. Add this to the 6 units,
giving (δὴ then the square root will be 2}- From this one-half of the
roots is subtracted, leaving 2, which is the number of men.

lee last section, on commercial transactions

There are certain customs of business which hold in buying, selling, ex-
change, and the like, according to two methods. The first method is illus-
trated: 10 things are sold for 6 drachmas, how many are sold for 4? The
second: 10 things are sold for 6 drachmas, what is the price of 4?

In the first case 10 things is the number priced, according to that which
is given, and 6 drachmas is the price, as given; the question, how many,
represents the unknown number of things, according to the question, and
4 drachmas the price, according to the question. In the second case, the
price and the quantity, as given, are the same as before; the question
represents the price, according to the problem, and 4 is the corresponding
quantity. Whence the price given is said to be in opposition to the price
sought, and similarly the quantity given to that sought. Multiply therefore
among themselves, and divide the product by the third kind, and the fourth
unknown will appear by the rules of four proportionals.
