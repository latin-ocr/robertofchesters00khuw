THE INFLUENCE OF AL—KHOWARIZMI’S ALGEBRA 39

influenced by Al-Khowarizmi. Paciuolo gives¹ the equation
«ΥΕ-1· 10x= 39

and presents the geometrical explanation as given by the Arab.
In certain others of the early printed algebras the fundamental or
type equations as given by Al-Khowarizmi do not appear. Of
such are the works by Grammateus appearing in 1518, by Chris-
tian Rudolph in 1525,”·’ and by Estienne de la Roche in 1520,3
whose work is known to have been a plagiarism of the thzparty
by Nicolas Chuquet (1484).⁴ However‚ many other writers did
continue the type problems of the first systematic treatise. Thus
Elia Misrachi ⁵ in an arithmetic which appeared in Constantinople
in 1534, eight years after the author's death, devotes a section to
algebra‚ and this is to a large extent an adaptation of the Algebra
and Almucabala. In the work by Perez de Moya (1562) θ and in
the arithmetic of 1539 by Cardan we come upon the type equations.
Mennher de Kempten‚ a Dutch mathematician‚ states that Algo-
rithmo was the first writer on algebra. Chaligai‚ the Italian, and
the Spaniard Pedro Nufiez follow the peculiar order of equations
found in Al-Khowarizmi. In these and other ways we might
trace through the centuries the persistent influence, direct and
indirect‚ of our Arabic author, but that is beside our present
purpose.

Among the writers who made a serious study of Robert of
Chester's translation we must place Johann Scheybl (1494—1570)‚
who was professor of mathematics at Tiibingen from about 1550
to the time of his death. He was the author of an algebra which
appeared in two editions in Paris, 1551 and 1552. This treatment
of algebra was first published in 1550 by Scheybl, prefixed to his
Greek and Latin edition of the first six books of Euclid. Scheybl

² I have not seen a copy of this edition. My remark is based upon Die Coss Chrsstqffs
Rudolffs (Konigsberg, 1553) by stifel. From certain notes about the history of the ter-
minology and the words dragma, res and substantia, and the like. it appears that Stifel
had seen a copy of Robert of Chester‘s version.
