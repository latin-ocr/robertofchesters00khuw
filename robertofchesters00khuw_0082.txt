56 INTRODUCTION

autore soamze Schenbelio, in inclyta Tubingensi academia Euclz'dis
professore ordinario. This is a briefer treatment ofthe algebra
than ‘that published by Scheybl in 1550, as a preface to the first
six books of Euclid, Euclz'a'is fllegarensis, Philosophi Asalliemalici
excellentissimi, sex libri priores. . . . Algebrae porro Reguhe,
propter numerorum exempla, passim propositionibus adiecta, liis
libris praemissae sunl, eaedemque demonstratae (Basle‚ 1550). This
algebra was published, separate from the Euclid, in Paris, in 1551.
The text of the algebra in the Columbia manuscript has not been
published.

strationes aequationum regularum A lgebrae. Our text.

Pages 1 23—157‚ Addita quaedam pro declaratione A lgebrae, by
Scheybl. This is explanatory of the preceding. It is printed on
pages 128 to 156 of this book.

Page 158, blank.

Pages 159—308‚ Liber Jordani Nemorarii de dalis in quatuor
parles digestus. This is not the complete text of the De numeris
datis, but contains the statement of the problems and their solu-
tions according to the rules of algebra. In these solutions Scheybl
introduces the use of Ν for number, co. for cosa, for the first power
of the unknown, and a symbol which is very similar to the square
root sign for the second power of the unknown, or substantia.

V. THE RELATIONS OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

The determination of the relation between the Vienna and
Dresden Mss.‚ as well as the relation of the Scheybl Ms. and the
two fragments to each of these, is based not only upon a study of
particular words and phrases but in large measure upon the omis-
sions made by the various scribes in copying. The main test
used is, appropriately enough for these mathematica] Mss.‚ an
arithmetical one.¹ In connection with the omissions we may
observe, as noted by Havet,2 that a copyist passes easily by error
from a given ending or word to a similar ending or word which
