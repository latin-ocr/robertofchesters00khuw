ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 149

or each part is now multiplied by 123 you will obtain x² -μ 7x equa]
to 744 units. By the first rule you take one-half of the roots and multiply
the half by itself, obtaining 12{, which being added to 744 will make a
total of 756} Take the square root of this and you obtain 273. Now from
27ss subtract the half of the roots, namely 3 and ὲ, and 24 remains as the
value of the square. This question is referred back to the chapter in which
squares and roots are equa] to a number.

F istlz question

I divided 10 into two parts and Ι multiplied each part by itself, and the
sum of the squares was 58. What are the two parts? The answer in accord-
ance with the rule is 7 and 3.

Rule. Multiply 10 — x by itself, and you obtain 100 units -4— x2 — 20 x;
then multiply x by itself, and 12 is obtained. You have then 100 units -1-
2 x² — 20 x, a total equal to 58. By restoration then of the negative 20 x, it
follows that 100 units ψ 2 x² equal 58 units ή- 20 Χ, and reducing this to
one square, 50 units 4- .1·2 are found equal to 29 units ψ 10 x. Accordingly,
by subtracting 29 from 50, 21 units -Ι- x² remain equal to 10 x. Proceed
therefore according to the second chapter, and it becomes clear that the
parts are 7 and 3. This problem is referred back to the chapter in which
squares and numbers are equa] to roots.

S ixtlz question

Ι multiplied ὲ x by ᾗ of it and obtained x -Ι- 2 units. What is the value
of x? The answer in accordance with the rule is 24.

Rule. Since you well know that the product of ἑ x by ὲ x, is 5¹5 x2, it fol-
lows that ila κζ’, in this instance, equals x -Ι- 24 units. Make the square
whole by multiplying all by 12, and you find that x² ψ 12 x is equal to 288
units. Treat this (equation), then, by multiplying the half of the roots by
itself and adding the product, or square, to 288. You obtain 324, whose
root is 18 ; this added to the half of the roots gives 24, the square which was
sought in the proposed question. This problem is referred back to the
chapter in which roots and numbers are equal to squares.

Severztlt question

Ι divided 10 into two parts in such a way that the product of one by the
other is 24. The question is, what are the parts? The answer in accord-
ance with the rule is 6 and 4.

Rule. You know that you can let the one part equal x, and the other
10 — x. Then multiply the one by the other and you obtain 10 x - x2,
which equals 24 units. Now by restoration say that 10 ,ν amounts to 24
units÷ 2⁴². Treat this then according to the chapter in which squares
and numbers are equal to roots, and it will be clear that one part is 6 and
the other 4.
