ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 145

Second problem

The root of 200 less 10, taken from twice that which is subtracted, namely
from 20, less the root 01 200, 15 1116 triple 01 11131 which was first subtracted,
namely 30, less two roots of 200.

The problem states that when you subtract 10 from the root 01 1116 1111111-
ber 200, and this in turn from 20, and from the remainder you take the root
of the number 200, then the triple, 30, of the quantity originally subtracted,
10, 1655 ¹ two roots 01 1116 number 200 remains. This will be proved in the
following manner :

Let the 11116 a b represent the root of 200, and let b c be 601131 10 11. Let
b d be 20, and further α e be 10. Cut off from the line b α 1116 11116 bsequal to
a e. Then the whole line dsis 30. Further, from the line c d cut off the line
c Ιι 601131 10 1116 11116 e b. Since the line e b is the root 01 200, less 10, and the
line c d is 20 1655 1116 1001 01 200, making the subtraction of the line e b from
the 11116 c d, you obtain the line lt d which 15 111611 30 1655 two roots of 200.

Moreover that 11115 11116 lzd 15 exactly 01 11131 length, Ι will prove. The
line sd 15 30, 311(1 since the line b c 15 1116 1001 01 200, 1116 11116 α e equals J' b,
and also the line eb equals clz. Hence by adding the two linesjb and ch
we shall obtain the root of 200. The subtraction being made there remains
the line hd. That therefore which was to be proved, has been proved.

Third problem
Two roots of any number make one 01 1116 quadruple.
This 15 sufficiently evident from the fact that any square 15 1116 quadruple
of another square if the side 01 1116 first 15 double the side 01 1116 other.

F 0 zcrtlz problem

One hundred and x² less 20 x, added to 50 plus 10 x less 2 x2, gives 150
less x² and less also 10 x.

Proof. VVhere 20 10015 316 subtracted and 10 roots are added, the result
15 1116 531116 35 11 only 10 roots were subtracted. Also where a square is
added and two squares are subtracted, the result 15 1116 531116 35 11 only one
square were subtracted. From this follows that which was proposed.

F ι’ rst question

Ι djvided 10 into two parts and multiplied one part by the other, then
Ι multiplied one part by 115611. Τ1115 product of one part by itself gave as
much 35 four times the product of one part by the other. What were the
two parts? The answer by the 11116 15 8 and 2.
