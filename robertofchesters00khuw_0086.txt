60 INTROD UCTION

generat diminutivam. Hoc igitur ad 10 res perueniet abiecta
substantia.

The scribe passed from perueniet to peruenz‘et two lines below.
Similar omissions, in length about 16 and 25 letters, are found in
the text, page 102, line 4, and page 40, line 19. The omission of
Α quibus 21 demptis after producemur 25 (page 110, line 8), is not
easily explained, but the omission in the text of page 96, line 17,
appears to be that of a complete line of 38 letters.

The single illustration of the repetition of a full line or more
in either Ms. occurs in the text on page 114, line 29, where the
scribe runs back from the coequantes at the end of one sentence
(line 29), to the [aequantes at the end of the preceding sentence;
the length is 54 letters. A shorter repetition occurs in the text
of page 116, line 6. In the text of page 84, lines 12—13:

Area igitur quam linee ί e, e a circumdant similis est aree quam
linee m l, ld circumdant. Area igitur t a similis est aree m d. . . .
we have noted that the Vienna scribe passed from the one Area
{gitur to the second; the Dresden scribe writes m after the first
similis es! arce, passing to the second, but he corrects the error.
The length here is 43 letters. Since one Ms. omits and the other
starts to omit this line, it was possibly omitted in the body of the
text of the parent, and supplied in the margin.

The Vienna manuscript contains on the first page two marginal
additions, somewhat in the nature of titles (see Plate I). To
these there correspond similar additions in the Dresden manu-
script, but while the latter continues with numerous other margi-
nal additions the Vienna manuscript does not follow that practise.
Among the particularly noteworthy marginal additions by the
first hand in the Dresden manuscript are the geometrica] figures
to be used in connection with the geometrical demonstrations of
the solutions of quadratic equations. The Vienna text contains
no such figures. But the Dresden figures are evidently not de-
rived directly from the figures in the Arabic text; they give every
evidence of being constructed by the writer of the Dresden manu-
script upon the basis of the geometrical explanation given in the
text. The lettering does not vary greatly from the Arabio, and
two of the figures are left quite incomplete.

The second hand has made in the Dresden text several marginal
additions based, in general, upon the Vienna manuscript, and once
