44 INTRODUCTION

fractionibm, on the same page of our text, seems to be an addition
by Robert. The introduction of the passage, ‘On Mercantile
Transactions‚’ pp. 120—124, is not at all carefully translated by
Robert‚ who retains poor transliterations ot four technical expres-
sions used in the Arabic. The four expressions in question refer
to the four terms of a proportion in which when three are given
the fourth is determined. If a given quantity of goods is sold at
a fixed or set price, then the price of any other quantity of the
same goods, or the amount of goods to be obtained for a given
sum of money, is determined by a proportion in which the three
given quantities enter. The unit of measure, or quantity sold at
a fixed price, is termed by Robert Almnsarar, instead of al-
mum-‘in and the fixed price Alszaran instead of (τί-εἴν,- the
quantity of goods desired is Almnllcemen, instead of al-77zutkamman
and the amount to be expended for goods is termed Althemen,
instead of cll-thaman. stlagul, which is used by Robert for the
unknown term in a proportion‚ would be in modern transliteration
al-maqnl.

Robert of Chester does not present the complete list of prob-
lems which occur. in the Arabic text of Al· Khowarizmi's algebra,
but only a selection of about one-half of the total number. Upon
what basis this selection was made does not appear, except that
typical problems are chosen, and the repetitions which are found
in the Arabic and the Libri text are eliminated. In the foot-
notes to our English version we have indicated the problems
which have been omitted by our author.

The translation of the text and solutions of the problems which
are given present peculiarities entirely similar to those which
have been noted in the preceding discussion of the Latin text by
Robert. A noteworthy omission is made both by Robert of Chester
and by the translator of the version published by Libri. This con-
cerns the fifth problem of the set of six whic'h illustrate in order
each of the six types of quadratio equations. After the solution
of the problem to the point to which our textl carries the prob-
lem, the Ambic, as translated by Rosen‚ adds: ‘Or, if you please,
you may add the root of four to the moiety of the roots; the sum
is seven, which is likewise one of the parts. This is one of the
problems which may be solved by addition and subtraction.’
