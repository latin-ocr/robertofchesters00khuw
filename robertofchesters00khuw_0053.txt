THE INFLUENCE OF AL—KHOWARIZMI’S ALGEBRA 35

Giouanni‚’' but either this manuscript is incomplete or the plan
was not carried out. Prominent also in the discussions is an
Augustinian monk, Gratia de Castellani (about 1340), famed as a
theologiam. The relatively large number of names of men who
had evidently attained something more than local repute in the
study of algebra shows the place which it had reached in in-
struction.

Another prominent writer of the fourteenth century, Johannes
de Muris, included a discussion of algebra in the third book of
his popular Quadrzparlz‘lum numerorum.1 Of this section of the
work of John of Meurs I have recently made a study‚2 showing
that he drew extensively from Leonard of Pisa and from Al-
Khowarizmi, thus continuing the Arabic influence. Regiomon-
tanus included the work in a list of important early works on
mathematics‚ and further Regiomontanus refers to algebra as the ars
rei et census This corresponds to a line of the Quadm‘parll'lum .·

“ Que tamen ars minor est quam sit de censibus et rei.’'

Later the expression, A rte magiore‚³ or A rs mayor,4 or Ars magma,5
was used for algebra‚ tracing back to this passage here given, in
which ars minor refers to arithmetic as opposed to algebra.
Adam Riese presents the problem,6 :62 -ἑ- 21 = lox, as being found
in the eleventh chapter of the third book of the Quadrlpartz'lum;
we have mentioned that this problem is one of the type problems
found in Al-Khowarizmi's algebra. Another French author who
gives an adaptation in Latin of the Arabic algebra is Rollandus,
Canon of St. Chapelle. At the command of John, Duke of Lan-
caster‚ Rollandus wrote in the year 1424 a compendium of mathe-
matics; the labor of composition was considerably lightened by
making large extracts from the Quadrzjffiarlz'tum, including most of
the arithmetic and algebra. A surnmary of the contents of the
