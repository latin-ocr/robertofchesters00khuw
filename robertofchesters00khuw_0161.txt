ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 131

An Illustration os tlte lez‘rd T ype

Four roots and twelve units are equal to a square.

Find, that is to say multiply, half of the roots by itself, and four
is obtained. To this add the 12 units, and 16 is obtained. Add the root
of this⁷ 4, to one-half of the roots and 6 appears as the root of the square.
Also whatever is given either greater or less than one square, reduce to one
square and operate as indicated above.1

The Explanation of tlte leree Types

The explanation of the first type is as follows: let the square AB repre-
sent x2. Then the side of this square will represent the root of x2. or x.
When one side of this square is multiplied by the number of the roots, the
quantity of the assumed roots is represented. Hence let there be applied to
each side of the square the fourth part of the number of the roots, namely
two roots to one side, two to another, and so on. Thus another square
appears, lacking only four small corner squares of which each has every side
equal to two, that is the fourth part of the number of the roots. There-
fore by multiplying the fourth part of the number of the roots by itself four
times, these four small corner squares are obtained, and this same result is
obtained by the multiplicatiori of half of the roots by itself once. If then the
product of half the roots multiplied by itself be added to the square and
roots‚ the square is formed of which one side is equal in value to the line cd.
Moreover, this side exceeds the side of the unknown square by the half of
the roots, since the side of the unknown square has been extended by the
fourth part at one extremity and by the fourth part at the other. Hence
by subtracting the half of the number of the roots from the whole line cd
the value appears of the root of the square which is sought.

The proof of this follows from the fourth proposition of the second book
of Euclid.²

³x² -1-8-Υ =33; ³² 2²8³· ÷16 =49; x ÷4 =73 x =3;-1·² =9·

⁴2x² ÷81=423 .x·² ÷4r = 21; :c 442· 44 = 253 x †2 =5; x =3.

⁵x² 415 =8.1·; x² -Sx ÷x6 = 1;.1·-4 = τὲ 13 x =3or5. Both roots are positive,
and so two solutions are given.

⁷x² -4-71 = bx; x = bg'z ss V(bs2)² — n.

The roots are imaginat-y if (bs'2)2 is less than n, as in the illustration which Scheybl gives3
similarly, the two roots are equa] to each other and each equal to one-hali the coefficient of the
roots if the square of this quantity is the same as the given constant, that is (bs2)² = n.

² Euclid ΙΙ, 4, following Heaffl, The Thirteen Books ⁰s Euclid’s Elements: “If a straight line
be cut at random. the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice
the rectangle contained by the segments.'' In modern notation, (a 4— b)‘-' = α2 -ὺ- b² -ι- 2 ab,
