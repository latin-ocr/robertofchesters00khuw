ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 147

Rule. You would let one part equal x and the other 10 — x; then
multiply x by 10 — x, giving 10x — 2⁴². Afterwards take the quadruple
of the total, which gives 40 x — 4 x2. This equals the product of x multi-
plied by x, which is 27². Now under the supposition of our question, x² is
equal to 40 x — 4 x2. Hence x² equals 8 x, whence x² is 64, and the root of
it is the number 8. One of the parts of 10 is then 8, and consequently
the remaining part is 2. This problem, then, is reduced to the chapter
wherein a square is equal to roots.

Second question

I divided 10 into two parts, and multiplied 10 by itself. Theresult
of this multiplicatiori was equal to the product of one of these parts multi-
plied by itself and by two and seven-ninths. What are the parts Ρ The
answer in accordance with the rule is 6 and 4.

Rule. Let x represent one of the two parts, which multiplied by itself
becomes x2. Double this square and add to it seven-ninths of one square,
giving 2} 21⁶² or ²55 x2. Hence if the whole square consists of nine parts (ninths)
that will be the fifth part and four-fifths of one-fifth of the whole, which is
twenty-five ninths. But under our supposition the product is equal to
100. Therefore take one-fifth, and ξ of one-fifth, of the number 100y
namely 36, which is the value of x2. The root of this, namely 6y is one part
of 10 in the proposed problem. This question then is referred back to the
chapter in which a square is equal to a number.

Third question

I divided 10 into two parts in such a way that the one part divided by
the other equaled 4. The question is, what are the parts? The answer in
accordance with the rule is 8 and 2.

Rule. Let x represent one part, and 10 — x the other. Now if by the
division of 10 — x by x there results 4, it follows that by the multiplication
of 4 by x you will obtain 10 -— x3 4 x„ then⁷ equals 10 — x, and hence 10 pre-
cisely equals 5x. The value of x is 2. This question is referred back to
that chapter in which a root is equal to a number.

F ourtlz question

Ι multiplied one-third 2⁴2 plus one unit by one-fourth x² plus one unit
and the result was 6 3. What is the value of x2? The answer in accordance
with the rule is 24.

Rule. Multiply one-third (x) by one-fourth (x), and one-twelfth ‚15² will be
the result ; then multiply one unit by ᾗ (x), and ὲ x will be the result ; again
multiply ὲ (x) by one unit, giving ὲ x, and finally a unit by a unit, giving a
unit. The sum total of this multiplicatiori is 1¹5 ‚1⁷² -Ι- ὲ x -4- } x -ψ- 1 which
equals 6 3 units. Take one unit from both sides⁷ and then, according to the
rule that it is always necessary to reduce to an integral square, the whole
