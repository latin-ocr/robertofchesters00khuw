ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 141

Fisth. Given to multiply 10 plus x by 10 less x.

Multiply 10 by 10, giving 100. Then multiply x by 10, giving positive
10 x. Third, multiply 10 by negative x, giving negative 10 x. Fourth,
multiply the positive x by the negative x, giving negative x2. The sum
total is 100 units less x2.

Sixtlz. Given to multiply x by 10 less x.

Multiply x by 10, giving 10 x; then multiply x by negative x, giving
negative x2. The total is therefore 10 x less x2.

Seventlz. Given to multiply x less 10 by 10 plus x.

Multiply x by 10, giving 10 x. Then multiply negative 10 by 10, giving
negative 100. Third, multiply x by x, giving positive x2. Fourth, multiply
negative 10 by x, giving negative 10 x. The total is therefore x2 less 100
units.

Eiglztlz. Given to multiply one-half a unit less 5 x by 10 plus ὲ x.

Multiply the half unit by 10, giving 5, Then multiply negative 5x
by 10, giving negative 50 x. Third, multiply the half unit by ἐκ, giving
{x positive. Fourth‚ multiply negative 5 x by ἐκ, which 15 the same as
multiplying 232· by x, giving 2} x² negative. The total therefore is 5
units less 2} 2⁵², and less 49} x.

N intlz. Given to multiply a unit less ὲ by a unit less ὲ of a unit.

Multiply a unit by a unit, then negative ὲ of a unit by a unity giving a
unit less ὲ 01 a unit Third, multiply a unit by negative ὲ 01 a unit, giving
negative ὲ 01 a um‘t. These give ἓ of a unit. Fourth, multiply negative >6¹-
by negative ὲ 01 a unit, giving positive ἐς The total is therefore twenty-
five thirty-sixths 01 a unit.

Tentlz. Given to multiply 10 plus x less 10 by 10 plus x. This is the
same as to multiply x by 10 plus x. Hence the product is x² plus 10 x.

Concerning the dombling, triffiing, and quadrupling o] radicals

It should be noted that when you wish to double the root of a square,
either a definite root or a surd, you multiply 2 by 2 and multiply the given
square by this product. The root of this product will be the double which
you seek 01 the root os the proposed square. Similarly 11 you wish its triple,
you multiply 3 by 3. And 11 you wish the quadruple 01 it, you multiply
4 by 4, and so on; and finally you multiply the proposed square by the
product3 the root of the product thus obtained will be the double, triple,
or quadruple, etc„ oi the proposed square.

A similar note on fractions

If you have it in mind to obtain half of the root, multiply one-half by
one-half, then the given square by the product. The root 01 this final
product gives the desired result. Similarly if you wish to have a third part,
multiply a third part by a third part, and so on.
