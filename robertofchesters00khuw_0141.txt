F irst Problem ¹

I divide ten into two parts in such a way that the product of one part
multiplied by the other gives 21.²

Now then we let x represent one part, which we multiply by 10 — x,
representing the other part. The product 10x - x2 is equal to 21 units.
Complete on by x‘·' and add this x2 to 21. This gives 10x equal to x² ÷ 21
units. Take one-half of the unknowns, i.e. 5, and multiply this by itself,
giving 25. From this subtract 21, giving 4. Take the root of this, 2, and
subtract it from half of the roots, leaving 3, which represents one of the parts.

Second Problem

I divide ten into two parts in such a way that each part being multiplied
by itself‚ the product of the smaller part taken from the product of the larger
part leaves 40.³

Explanation. You multiply 10 - x by itself, giving 100 -Ι- x² — 20x.
You multiply x by itself, giving 2⁸², which you take from 100 -l- x2 — 20x‚
leaving 100 - 20x equal to 40 units. Therefore by adding 20x to the
40 units complete 100 units by 20x. This gives 100 equal to 40 units 4- 20 x.
Therefore you take 40 from 100, leaving 60 units equal to 20x. Three is
then the value of x and represents one part.

T lzird Problem

I divide ten into two parts in such a way that when to the sum of the
products of each part by itself is added the difference between the two parts
the sum total will be 54 units.¹¹

1 The sixteen problems which follow are selected by Robert of Chester from twice that num<
ber in the Arabic text. The Boncompagni version presents nine, including the first, second,
third, and fifth of this list.

The Boncompagni version interjects (loc. cit„ pp. 45—46) before these problems: “pro rnul-
titudine <lata assignatur horum muttatione quaslibet questiones secundum restauracionem pro-
positas in predictos modos solubiles esse palam est. Cuius utilitas ad documentum libri
elementorum precipua est. in inveniendis scilicet lineis alogis et medialibus binomiis et residuis
sive reccisis que per notum numerum assignari non possunt. In practica quoque geometrie et
universis questionibus ignotorum secundum arismeticam formatis certissima via est.''

² ,τωο - x) = 21, which leads to the type equation given earlier in the work, ,τῖ -4- 21 = 10 x,
and indeedv it incidentally appears a second time in the preceding set of problems. The Arabic
text precedes the statement of this problem, Rosen, op. cil., p. 41, as follows: ‘¹ If a person puts
such a question to you as . . .’'·‚ the Boncompagni version, loc. cit, p. 46. precedes: “Igitur
sub formas precedencium et alias questiones proponimus. Queritur. . . . '³

³ (10 — .ι·)2 - ,ι-’-“ = 40, whence 100 — 20 x = 403 20 ‚r = 60, x = 3, which is the value of the
root.

⁴x² ÷(10 —x)²÷10— 2x = 54, whence 2x2— 22x ÷110= 54; 2x² 4- 110 = 54÷22x
