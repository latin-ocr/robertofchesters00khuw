of these tables, with extracts from the Latin text, was made by
A. A. ijrnbo1 and the completed work, edited by Suter, has
recently been published. Suter has found 2 that this translation is
not of the original work by Al-Khowarizmi‚ but is based on a revi-
sion of that work made by Maslama al-Majriti (about 1000 A.D.).
The work is of considerable importance for the history of trigonom-
etry, for even though the tangent function which appears therein
may be the addition of Maslama, yet the introduction of the sine
function is certainly carried back as far as Al-Khowarizmi.

The combination of mathematical, geographicah and astronomi-
cal interests exhibited by Al-Khowarizrni renders plausible the
hypothesis advanced by Suter,3 on chronological grounds, that
this Mohamrned ibn Musa took part in the measurernent of a
degree of the earth's circumference which was made at the request
of the caliph Al-Mamun. Some early Arabic chroniclers join the
three sons ot Moses, the Beni Musa, in this task. The oldest of
these brothers was Moharnmed and so he was called after the
Arabic custom, Mohamrned ibn Musa, meaning Mohammed‚ the
son of Moses. Abu Ja‘far is the prefix to his name, and this has
been incorrectly given by numerous modern dictionaries4 as the
name of our author.

Concerning Mohammed ibn Musa‘s farne among the Arabs as
an algebraist abundant evidence exists. Not only the commen-
taries cited bear witness to this sanie but also the recurrent
appearance for centuries of the numerical examples, x²÷ 10x= 39.
x2÷ 21 = 10 x, 3x÷4=x2 and many others, which Al-Khowarizrni
used. Some of the later authors, like Abu Kamil Shoja‘ ibn
Aslam ⁵ (about 925 A.D.)‚ explicitly acknowledge their indebtedness
