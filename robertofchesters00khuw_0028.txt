10 INTRODUCTION

Now the Arabio Book of Chronicles¹ (987 A.D.) states that the
astronomer Hipparchus (second century B.c.) wrote a treatise on
algebra, and Cantor2 inclines to the belief that there actually was
such a work. No trace, however. has been found of it, and the
probability is that Hipparchus did not write any systematic trea-
’ tise on algebra or on quadratic equations. The word “algebra'’
indeed is Arabio in its origin and the use of it as a title goes back
only to the time of our author, Mohammed ibn Musa. Neverthe-
less it is possible that Greek mathematicians of the time of
Hipparchus did occupy themselves with problems of the kind in
question, because this was a natural development out of the con-
sideration of rational right triangles, as given by Pythagoras and
Plato, in connection with the geometrical treatment of quadratic
equations as given by Euclid. Quadratic equations connect even
more directly with the application of areas, of Pythagorean origin,
which is extensively treated by Euclid.

Some two centuries after the period of Diophantus, Eryabhata
one of the earliest Hindu mathematicians of prominence, was born
(476 Α.1).). In the work of ,ſs—Xryabhata as presented by Rodet³
we find the solution of a quadratic equation assumed in the rule
for finding the number of terms of an arithmetic series when the
sum, difference‚ and first term are given. Nor does Kryabhata
in India stand alone in the study of analysis, as Diophantus
does in Greece. Brahmagupta of Ujjain, the centre of Indian
learning, wrote on algebra in the early part of the seventh century
and gave a rule4 for the solution of quadratic equations:

“To the absolute number multiplied by the [coefficient of the] square, add the
square of half the [coefficient os the] unknown, the square root of the sum, less half

the [coefficient of the] unknown, being divided by the [coefficient of the] square, is
the unknown.”

In formula this corresponds to the solution
