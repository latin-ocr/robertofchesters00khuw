ADDITIONS To THE ALGEBRA 153

ter in which a square and numbers are equal to roots. Multiplying one-
half of the roots by itself you have 2 53 from this subtract 24 and there re-
mains one, of which the root is one. Subtract this root frorn the half of the
number of the roots, and four remains as the value of one part. Now note
that when the quotient obtained by dividing the first part by the second
part of any whole is multiplied by the quotient of the second part by the
first, that which is obtained is always the same.

Eleventlz question

I divided ten into two parts and Ι multiplied one of these by five⁷ and the
product Ι divided by the other part; one-half of this result I added to the
product of the first part multiplied by 5, and the sum total was fifty. The
question is stated. The answer in accordance with the rule is 8 and 2.

Rule. You may take x as one part of 5; this you wil] multiply by 10,
giving 5x. You should divide 5x by 10— x, and add ὲ of the quotient
to 5 x. But this is the same as if you should divide ὲ of 5 x by 10— x
and add the total result to 5 ,ιη either operation gives 50. If therefore you
divide 2ss x by 10 — x, 50 — 5 x is obtained, since when 5 x was added to the
quotient, the sum was given as 50. Moreover it should be evident that the
product of the result of any division multiplied by the divisor gives your
quantity (the dividend), which is 2} x. Therefore multiply 10 - x by
50— 5 x, obtaining 500-4— 5 x2— 100 x, all of which is equal to 2} x. Re-
duce the whole then to one square by taking the fifth part of the whole, and
it will be clear that 100 -l- .r² — 20 x equals ὲ x. By restoration then say that
100 -†— -r2 equals 20 x and ὲ x. Operate then by the chapter in which
squares and numbers are equal to roots. Multiplying one-half of the roots
by itself, 105 and 1¹6 is obtained; from this you subtract 100, leaving 51¹5,
of which the root is ἡ, and this being subtracted from one-half of the roots
8 remains as the value of one part.

T welf tlz question

I divided 10 into two parts, and the product of one of these parts by itself
contained the other part 81 times. The question is as to the parts. The
answer in accordance with the rule is 9 and 1.

Rule. Multiply 10 — x by itself, giving 100 4- x² — 20 x, which is
equal to 81 x. Then by restoration. say that 100 ÷ ,272 equals to 101 x.
Operate now by the chapter in which squares and numbers are equal to
roots, and unity will finally appear as the value of one part.

leirteentlz question

There are two quantities of which the greater exceeds the less by two.
I divided the greater by the less and the quotient was one-half the greater
quantity. The question is stated. The answer in accordance with the
rule is 2, for the smaller quantity, and 4 for the larger.
