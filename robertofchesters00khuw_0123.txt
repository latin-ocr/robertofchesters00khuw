10, 100, and positive 2 multiplied by 10 gives positive 20. Also 10 multi-
plied by negative r gives negative 10. This sum, moreover, amounts to
110. But positive 2 multiplied by negative 1 gives negative 2. Whence
the sum total of this multiplicatiori equals 108.¹ And this illustrates the
type of process when units are to be added and others to be subtracted.²

Likewise in the case of fracffions, if the problem is a unit and one-sixth
(to be multiplied) by a unit and one-sixth. You say, unit by unit gives
unit3 and one-sixth of a unit by a unit gives one-sixth of a unit. Also one-
sixth by a unit gives one-sixth and one-sixth by a sixth gives one-sixth of a
sixthy i.e. one thirty-sixth. The total will be a unit and ὲ and ἐς of a unit.

In the sanie manner, if you multiply a unit less one-sixth by a unit less
one-sixth, the product will be the same as ἓ multiplied by its equal. Whence
this product equals 25 thirty-sixths of one unit, i.c, ξ and ὲ of one-sixth.

Now the method of this multiplicatiori is that you multiply unit by unit,
giving unit; then negative one-sixth by unit⁷ giving negative one-sixth;
then you multiply a unit by negative one-sixth‚ giving one-sixth negative.
Therefore two-thirds of one unit remain. And negative one-sixth multi-
plied by negative one-sixth produces one-sixth of one—sixth positive. The
sum total therefore amounts to ξ and one-sixth of one-sixth.³

¹ Scheybl adds : Moreover this is evident by the following calculation :

10÷2
10- 1
100-4-20

—10

 

 

110
-—²

108

Similarly to the example which immediately precedes this Scheybl adds: as follows:

 

10 - 2
10 — Ι
100 —- 20
-Ε
[0
÷ 112]
71[72]

² Evidently considerable interchange of text was made at this point by Scheybl. The passage
inserted in the footnote to line 6 should be compared with the 28 lines of Scheybl's text on
page 94, which are not found at that point in the Dresden and Vienna manuscripts.

³ Scheybl adds: The calculation follows:

 

 

unit — ὲ
unit -ὲ
unit — ὲ
giving ξ
Add ὲ of ὲ.

Whence the product of this multiplicatiori finally amounts to ξ plus ἐς,
