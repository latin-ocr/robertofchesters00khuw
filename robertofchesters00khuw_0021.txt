ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS BEFORE AL—KHOWARIZMI 3

an arc is swung with a radius of four units, while from the other
end an arc is swung with a radius of five units. The intersection
is connected with the peg from which the shorter arc is swung,
forming thus a right angle with the desired line, for in any tri-
angle with sides in the ratio three to four to five, a right angle
lies opposite the longest side.

The Pythagorean theorem was applied also in India, before the
time ot Pythagoras, in the construction of altars. With this
theorem as developed in the Apastamba Sulba Sutras,1 the rules
for altar construction, are associated careful approximations of
square root, pure quadratio equations‚ and even, as Milhaud has
shown,2 the possible solution of the complete quadratic equation,

(1962 -†- bx: c.

The ancient Babylonians, furthermooe, constructed tables of
squares and cubes. Such tables are found upon the famous
tablets of Senkereh‚³ which are contemporary with the Ahmes
papyrus. Application of these quadratic numbers to problems
similar to those of Egypt already mentioned has not been dis-
covered, but the fact is evident that such tables were a step toward
the study of quadratic equations. Cantor4 shows that the ancient
Hebrews were probably familiar with the 3, 4, 5 right triangle. In
China, too, students mathematically inclined had come upon this
number relation‚⁵ and evidently were studying quadratic numbers.

Familiarity of Greek mathematicians with the geometrical
solution of quadratio equations in the time of Pythagoras is now
well established.6 'Hippocrates (fifth century Bc.) writing on the
quadrature of the lunes, in an attempt to square the circle,
assumes a construction which is equivalent to the solution of the

equation‚⁷
