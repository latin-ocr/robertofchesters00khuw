1 6 INTRODUCTION

Chaucer, is derived from the use of the name Al·Khowarizmi in
the opening sentence of the arithmetic, which reads, Dixit
algoritmi or ‘Algorithm says'; the word ‘algebra' is derived
from its use as a title by Al-Khowarizmi in the work which we
are presenting.1 Up to the eighteenth century the common name
for the new arithmetic with the ten figures of India, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 o, was algorism, or in Latin algorismus. Interesting also is
the fact that a Spanish transliteration of Khowarizm, guarismo, is
used for ‘ numerals,‘ corresponding to our ordinary use of ‘ciphers.'
Aside from Al-Khowarizmi's arithmetic in Latin translation, which
was never widely used, the works which served to introduce the
numerals into Europe were the Carmen de A lgorismof in verse,
written by Alexander de Villa Dei (about 1220), and the Algorz‘smus
vulgaris3 by John of Halifax, commonly known as Sacrobosco
(about 1250). Both of these works were somewhat dependent upon
Mohammed ibn Musa's arithmetic, and both continued in wide use
for centuries. Many manuscript copies of the Carmen are found
in European libraries‚ and rather more of the Algorismus vulgaris.
Even after the invention of printing Sacrobosco's Algorism was
widely used for university instruction in arithmetic, many editions
appearing in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries4 Detailed and
extended commentary upon the work was given by Petrus de
Dacia in 1291, in his lectures‚ evidently, and probably in a similar
manner by many other university lecturerS.

Another arithmetical treatise ascribed to Al-Khowarizmi is
found in the Liber ysagogarum A lclzorz'smi in artem astronomi-
cam a magistro A. compositus.⁵ The principles of arithmetic‚
geometry, music, and astronomy are explained in five books, or
Chapters, and in two manuscripts there follow three books on
