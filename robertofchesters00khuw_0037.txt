AL-KHOWARIZMI AND HIS TREATISE ΟΝ ALGEBRA 19

to our author. Others, like the poet Ornar ibn Ibrahim al-Khay-
yami (about 1045-1123 A.D.)‚ familiar to English readers as Omar
Khayyam, and Mohammed ibn al-Hasan al-Karkhi (died about
1029), do not consider it necessary to state the source of these
problems and the pmofs, which had become classic. Thus the

equauon
x²÷ 10x= 39

runs like a thread of gold through the algebras for several cen-
turies, appearing in the algebras of the three writers mentioned,
Abu Kamil, Al-Karkhi1 and ‘Omar al-Khayyami‚2 and frequently
in the works of Christian writers, centuries later, as we shall have
occasion to note below.

Recognition of the fame of Al-Khowarizmi is to be found in the
explicit statement by Ibn Khaldun (1332—1406) in his encylopaedic
work ³: “The first who wrote upon this branch (algebra) was Abu
‘Abdallah al-Khowarizmi, after whom came Abu Kamil Shoja‘ ibn
Aslam.’' Haji Khalfa‚ some two hundred years later, makes a
similar statement. The Clzronz'cles of tlze Learuea' by Ibn al-Qifti
(d. 1282 A.D.) speak very highly of his ability as an arithmetician‚4
and a contemporary of AlQisti, Zakariya ibn Moh. ibn Mahmud
al-Qazwini, refers to him as translating the art of algebra for the
Mohammedans.⁵

Ι have recently made a study 6 of the algebra of Abu Kamss, whose
name we have seen associated by Arabio historians with that of
Al-Khowarizmi. Ihave shown that he drew extensively upon the
work of his predecessor, and further that Leonard of Pisa (1202
Α.[).) dreW, in turn, even more extensively from Abu Kamil. Thus
the influence of the Khowarizrnian was carried over to Italy as
well as to the Arabic commentators and the European translators

earlier work by Al-Karkhi which includes a treatment of algebra.
