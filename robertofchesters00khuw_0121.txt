Now further the method is to be explained by which you multiply un-
known quantities or roots, either when alone, or when numbers are joined to
them or subtracted from them. or when they are subtracted from numbers;
also in what manner they are added to, or, in turn, subtracted from, each
other.

In the first place you should understand that the only way to multiply a
number by a number is to take the number to be multiplied as many times
as there are units in the number by which it is to be multiplied.¹ When
therefore the nodes 2 of numbers are proposed either with some units or if
units are subtracted from them, then the multiplication is fourfold, i.e.‚ first
the nodes are multiplied by the nodes, then the units by the nodes and the
nodes by the units, and finally the units by the units⁴ When therefore
the units which accompany the nodes are both added or both subtracted
the fourth product is to be added. But if one is added and the other sub-
tracted then the fourth product is to be subtracted.

A problem of this kind is given by the following : 10 and 2 are to be multi-
plied by 10 and 1. Hence multiply 10 by 10, giving 100; then 2 by 10,
giving 20 to be added; likewise 10 by 1, giving 10 to be added. Two by 1
gives 2 to be added. The sum total of this multiplicatiori is finally 132.3
And this illustrates what we have said in respect to the type in which the
units which accompany the nodes are both to be added.4

But when you wish to multiply 10 less 2 by 10 less 1, you say 10 by 10
gives 100; 2 to be subtracted by 10 gives 20 to be subtracted; also 10
by 1 gives 10 to be subtracted. This total, then, amounts to 70. But
negative 2 multiplied by negative one gives positive 2. Therefore the sum
total is finally 72.⁵ This illustrates what we have said when both (bino-
mials) involve negatives.

Moreover if you wish to multiply 10 and 2 by 10 less 1, you say 10 by

¹ To this definition Al-Khowarizmi refers in his arithmetic (Τναίίαῑῐ, Ι, p. 10).

² Scheybl adds that this is a word of uncertain and obscure meaning. The Arabic word ‘aqud
is connected with the verb meaning “to knot,'' referring to tying knots on a string to indicate
numbers. The Libri and Boncompagni texts use artz's11l1‘‚xvhile Rosen translates* greater numbers.'

³ The Columbia manuscript continues with the following addition by Scheybl:

The calculation is as follows: 10 4- 2
10 *f* 1

 

100 20
10 r [written by mistake for 2]
132

⁴ This is one of the early attempts at a discussion of the multiplicatiori ofbinomina15‚ including
(x ÷ a) times (x 4- b), (x — α) times (x - b), and (r - α) times (r -4- b).

⁵ Scheybl's text contains by error 81 for 72. The problem as given in the Arabio and Libri
versions is (10— 1) by (10— 1) with the product 81. This undoubtedly was given by Robert
of chester, and is so recorded in the Vienna and Dresden MSS. Scheybl evidently varied from
the text before him, but neglected to make necessary changes in the numerica] computation.
