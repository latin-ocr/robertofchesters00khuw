equal to 6 units. I take one-half of the roots and I multiply the half by
itself. I add the product to 6, and of this sum I take the root. The re-
mainder obtained after subtracting one-half of the roots will designate the
first number of girls, and this is two.

F ifteentlz Problem

If from a square I subtract four of its roots and then take one-third of the
remainder, finding this equal to four of the soors, the square will be 256.¹

Explanation. Since one-third of the remainder is equal to four roots,
you know that the remainder itself will equal 12 roots. T herefore add this
to the four, giving 16 roots. This (16) is the root of the square.

S ixteentlz Problem

From a square I subtract three of its roots and multiply the remainder
by itself 3 the sum total of this multiplicatiori equals the square.2

Explanation. It is evident that the remainder is equal to the root,
which amounts to four. The square is 16.

These now are the sixteen problems which are seen to arise from the
former oneS‚ as we have explained. Hence by means of those things which
have been set forth you will easily carry through any multiplicatiori that
you may wish to attempt in accordance with the art of restoration and
opposition.

CHAPTER ΟΝ MERCANTILE TRANSACTIONS³

Mercantile transactions and all things pertaining thereto involve two
ideas and four numbers.‘² Of these numbers the first is called by the Arabs
Almuzahar and is the first one proposed. The second is called Alszian, and
recognized as second by means of the first. The third, Ahnuhen‚ is unknown.
The fourth, Alchemon‚ is obtained by means of the first and second. Further,
these four numbers are so related that the first of them, the measure, is
inversely proportional to the lasty which is cost. Moreover, three of these
numbers are always given or known and the fourth is unknown, and this

In the Arabic text these two problems precede: x² . 3 x = 5 x² and (x2 — ἐπὶ) . 3 x = x².

² Rosen, p. 673 Libri, p. 206. (πθ - 3 x)² = πῖ, whence x² — 3 x = x.

The problem, A· 4- xlx² — ,ι- = 2, precedes. This is one of two problems given in the German
excerpt of 1461 from the algebra of Al-Khowarizmi (Gerhardt, Monatsbericlzl d. Keinigl. Akad. der
Wissensclzaftcn :u Berlin, 1870, pp. 142—143).

³ The famous ‘rule οἱ three' is the subject oi discussion in this chapter.

⁴ The two ideas appear to be the notioris of quantity and cost; the four numbers represent
unit of measure and price per unit, quantity desired and cost of the same. These four technical
terms are al-mzcsd Ἔν, al-si'r‚ al-tlzaman‚ and al-muthammin, and further al-maqal; see p. 44.
