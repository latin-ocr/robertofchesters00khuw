ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 143

On tlte division os radicals

Notice, if you wish to divide the root 01 9 by the root 01 47 divide 9 by
4, giving 2} Of the result take the root, which is Ιὲ, and the resulting
number will be the quotient 01 1116 root divided by the root. But 11 you
wish to divide two roots 01 9 by the root 01 1116 number 4, you seek first the
double 01 the root 01 9 according to that which we have explained, and
divide the product by the number 4.

On the multiplicatiori os radicals

If you wish to multiply the root 01 1116 number 9 by the root of the num-
ber 4, multiply 9 by 4 and the root 01 1116 product is that which you seek.
Other multiplications are similar.

Thus 11 you wish to multiply the root 01 ὲ by the root 01 ὲ, you multiply
ὲ by ὲ, giving ὲ, and the root of this is that which you seek.

In the same way 11 you wish to multiply two roots 01 9 by three roots 01
4⁷ you first try to find, as we have explained above, the square whose root
is twice the root 01 1116 number 9. Similarly you try to find the square
whose root is three times the root 01 1116 number 4, and you multiply the one
square by the other. The root 01 1116 product will be that which you seek.

N ow follow four problemsl: First problem

The root of 200 less 10, added to the double 01 11131 which is subtracted‚
in other words to 20, will be equal to 10 when the root of 200 is 5111)11361661.2

The problem says that if from the root 01 1116 number 2007 10 15 subtracted‚
and 11 111611 20 15 added to that which remains⁷ and 11 110111 11115 511111 1116 1001
01 1116 number 200 15 taken away, we finally have left that which was sub-
tracted, namely 10. This will be proved in the following manner:

Let a b represent the root 01 200, and from it cut off the line ac, repre-
senting 10. Then to the line a b join b d, a line which is 20 (units in length).
From 11115 6111 011 b e, equal to the line a b, and from b e cutoff the line bs equal
to the line ac; the line c b will be equal to the line se. Moreover the line
c b 15 1116 1001 01 200 1655 10, and the line ed 15 20 1655 1116 1001 01 200. The
line c b 15 equal to the line se, whence the line sd equals the root 01 200 1655
10 plus 20 less the root 01 200. Moreover I shall prove that this line sd
15 exactly 10. The line b d is 20, and as bfis equal to the line α cy which was
taken as 10, it follows then that the line f d, on account 01 11115 equality, is
10, which was to be proved.

¹ This and the following three problems 316 not given by Robert of Chester, although the
Libri and Arabic versions give the first, second, and fourth problems, and the Boncompagni text
the first and second. Scheybl was probably familiar with the other Latin text, the one published
by Libri. The geometrical figure in the Libri text is an L-shaped figure, and the same reversed
in the Arabic text. In each οἱ these the vertical line represents wlff).

² The geometrical demonstration of this simple algebraic addition is relatively complicated;
in algebraic symbolism, 1]ἷο - 10-1- 20 — wlff: 10, and similarly below.
