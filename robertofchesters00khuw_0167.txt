ADDITIONS To THE ALGEBRA 137

and dg are equal, then by subtracting equals from equals the line am will
be equal to the line gc by this well-known axiom. On account of this
equality the same line am will, by another axiom,¹ be equal to the line eg
and hence also to kk. Further‚ since the lines lte and eg are equal to each

other and also the lines ne and dg are equal, then by subtracting equals from 1

equals the line nlz is equal to the line de. On account of this equality the
same line nh will be equal to the line mn. Hence the areas hl and mf are
equal. Theret'ore the two areas dn and hl taken together, by the well-
known axiom “if equals be added to equals‚‘' will be equal to the single
area ds, which contains 1 2 units. Whence if the number 12 be added to the
square ek, whose side or root is the line eg, the half of the number of the
roots, the square dl is obtained whose side or root is the line dg. If, then, the
half of the number of the 10015, which is represented by the line ge, be
added to that side (dg) the line dc will be obtained, which is the side of the
unknown square. The proposed problem is solved.
The geometrical figures follow.

M ulti plication with Positives and N egatz'ves ²

Since the multiplicatiori of a composite³ number by a composite number
is the same as the multiplicatiori of each part of the one composite by each
part of the other⁷ so it follows that the multiplicatiori is fourfold‚ namely
article by article, digit by article, then article by digit, and fourthly digit
by digit. Similarly, you may have a fourfold multiplicatiori when an article
and a digit is to be multiplied by an article less ⁴³ a digit, or the reverse.⁵
It seems desirable to indicate the fourfold nature of this multiplicatiori (by
some examples), and in every multiplication of this kind this rule is to be

¹ The halves oi equals are equal, and the axiom oi the preceding note.

² Attention is called to a similar use of this expression in the text (p. 32). Johannes de Muris
in the third book of the chadripartitum numerorum, doubtless familiar to Scheybl, entitles a
similar chapter, De multiplicatione et diuisione, additarum ct diminutorum (Cod. Pal. Vind. 4770,
fol. ²30 8); 566 also Karpinski, The “Quadriportitum numerorum’' of John of Meurs, loc. cit„
p. 110.

³ In this discussion Scheybl uses the more common terms such as “composite numbers‚''
“articles” and ⁴‘digits,'' instead of “modes'' and “units'' as in the corresponding section oi
Robert of Chester's text (pp. 88-96).

⁴ praeter is used to suggest the idea of negative, illustrating in fact the Arabic conception of
negative, namely that the “article'' or ten (in this instance) is incomplete by the digit which 15
subtracted from 11,

(x —- a)(x — b). That multiplication is commutative was doubtless 1611, 6ν611 though not
expressed.
