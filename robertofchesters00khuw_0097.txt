THE BOOK OF ALGEBRA AND ALMUCABOLA¹

CONTAINING DEMONsTRATIONs OF THE RULES OF THE
EQUATIONS OF ALGEBRA

Written some time ago in Arabic by an unknown author and afterwards, according
to tradition in 1183,2 put into Latin by Robert of Chester in the city of Segovia.

THE BOOK OF ALGEBRA AND ALMUCABOLA

The Book of Algebra and Almucabola, concerning arithmetical and geomet-
rica] problems.

In the name of God, tender and compassionate‚ begins the book of Resto-
ration and Opposition of number put forth by Moharnmed Al-Khowarizmi,
the son of Moses. 3 Mohammed said Praise God the creator who has be-
stowed upon man the power to discover the significance of numbers. Indeed,
reflecting that all things which men need require computation Ι discovered
that all things involve number and Ι discovered that number is nothing
other than that Which is composed of units. Unity therefore is implied in
every number. Moreover I discovered all numbers to be so arranged that
they proceed from unity up to ten. The number ten is treated in the same
manner as the unit, and for this reason doubled and tripled just as in the case
of unity. Out of its duplication arises 20, and from its triplication 30. And
so multiplying the number ten you arrive at one-hundred. Again the num-
ber one-hundred is doubled and tripled like the number ten. So by doub-
ling and tripling etc. the number one-hundred grows to one-thousand.
In this way multiplying the number one-thousand according to the various
denominations of numbers you come even to the investigation of number
to infinity.

Furthermore Ι discovered that the numbers of restoration and opposition

¹ Algebra and almucabola are transliterations of Arabic words meaning ‘the restoration‚' or
⁴ making whole,' and ¹ the opposition‚' or ⁴ balancing.' The first refers to the transference of nega-
tive terms and the second to the combination of like terms which occur in both members or to
the combination of like terms in the same member. For a discussion of the terms algebra and
alniusabola, see Karpinski, Algcbra, in ilIodcrn Language Notos, Vol. XXVII (1913), p. 93. Al-
Karkhi included these two operations under algcbm and the simple equating oi the two members
as almnsabola, but Woepcke adds (Extrait du Faklzri, p. 64) that this is contrary to the common
usage. The title ‹zlssjcbr w'dvlmuqtlbala is still used in Arabic. The Arabio verb stem jbr„ from
which algebra is derived, means ‘ to restore.y So in Spain and Portugal a surgeon was called an
algebrista. See also note 3, p. 107.

² The date is given in the Spanish Era; 1145 A.D., according to our reckoning.

³ Moharnmed ibn Musa, Al-Khowarizmi. The word algorism is derived from his patronymic;
the spelling and use in the Latin (see p. 76, line 18), indicate the process oi evolution, although
the term came into use through Al-Khowarizmi 's arithmetic and not his algebra.
