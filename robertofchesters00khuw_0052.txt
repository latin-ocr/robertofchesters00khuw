34 INTRODUCTION

et αιίηιιιιΙιαόαία.1 The first draft of this work was written in 1202,
and in 1228 a revised and enlarged version appeared, dedicated to
Michael Scotus. Woepcke has shown that Leonard drew many
of his problems from Al-Khowarizmi,² but some of these may have
corne indirectly through Abu Karnil, from whom, as Ι have
shown‚³ Leonard took many of his algebraic problems. In the
manuscripts of the Italian’s treatise the only mention of Al-
Khowarizmi is in the margin, simply Maumet, at the beginning
of the Section dealing with algebra; but the term algorismus
occurs for arithmetic.⁴²

In the century following Leonard of Pisa, another Italian
mathematician, William of Luna, is reputed to have put Al-
Khowarizmi⁷s algebra into the Italian language. Raffaello di
Giovanni Canacci, a Florentine citizen of the fifteenth century,
states in an Italian work on algebra,⁵ as yet in manuscript, that
William had translated the rules of algebra out of Arabic into “our
language.'' Reference to his work is also made by at least three
writers of the sixteenth century, the Florentine Francesco Ghaligai‚
the Spaniard Marco Aurel, and another Spaniard Antich Rocha
of Gerona.⁶ An Italian manuscript of 1464 in the library of
George A. Plimpton, Esq., of New York, does contain an Italian
version of the Algebra of Al-Khowarizmi in which reference is
made to William of Luna as a translator of algebra. The possi-
bility is that we have here the version of William. The writer of
the manuscript is not known, but he explicitly states that he bases
his treatise on the labours of numerous predecessors in this field.
One chapter, as Ι have shown in a recent study of this manu-
script‚⁷ deals with the algebra of an unknown Maestro Biagio
(died 1340) and to Leonard of Pisa another section is devoted.
The writer purposed also to deal with the works of a “subtle
Maestro Antonio‚'' doubtless Antonio Mazzinghi da Peretola, who
wrote a treatise on algebra called z'l fioretto, and a “Maestro
