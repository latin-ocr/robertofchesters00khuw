the square e n m c upon the line e c, which is of the length by which the line
t e c exceeds the line α lt. Whence⁷ since t c equals l c, being found in the
square t l, and similarly since e c equals m c, these being equal dimensions of
the square e m, and further equal lines being subtracted from equal lines,
it is evident that t e is left equal to l m. This is to be noted.

Again it is evident that the line g d is equal to a h, since they represent in
breadth equal dimensions of the area lz g, and the line a lz equals lz b as they
appear in one
square. Also α
since the line gl
is equal to d e,
being found in
the same square,
and d e is equal
to lze,each being J„
the half of ten
roots, therefore
the line d l, the
residuum of the
line g l, is equal
to e b, the resi-
duum of the line e lz. And 50, as the line t e, by the above demonstration,
is not unequal to the line l m, the area which is included by the lines t e and
e b is equal to the area comprehended by the lines l m and d l. Therefore
the area t b equals the area m d. The square t l equals 25. Therefore
when we subtract from this same square t l the areas d t and m d, which are
of course equal to the two areas g e and t b, containing 21, it is evident that
we have left the square n e, which amounts to the difference between 25
and 21. This number is four, of which the root is two, and this gives the
line e c. Moreover e c equals d l, since each represents the breadth of the
area d c. Since d l equals e b, it is evident that when e b, which is two, is

taken from ε Ιι, which is hals
of the roots, or five, three
remains for the line b Ιι.

Therefore three is the root
of the first x2.

On the contrary if we add
the line e c to the line elz, rep-
resenting half of the roots,
