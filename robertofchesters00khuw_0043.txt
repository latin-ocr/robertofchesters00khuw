ROBERT OF CHESTER AND OTHER TRANSLATORS OF ARABIC 25

Musa's works, for he mentions him as one of the Arabic math-
ematicians.¹ Contemporary with these men was Robert of Chester.
The assertion was made by Curtze ‘² that the Liber embadorum,
Book of Measnres, in Hebrew, by Abraham bar Chiyya Ha Nasi,
known as Savasorda, was the first work to appear in Latin show-
ing to the Western world how the solution of quadratic equations
is accomplished. This statement is made on the basis of the date
DX ot the Hegira for the translation of the work made by Plato
of Tivoli. It has recently been shown by Haskins,3 on the basis
of astronomical data in the work, that this date is undoubtedly
a scribe's error for DXL, corresponding to 1145 A.D. Savasorda
was approximately contemporary with his translator. Of the early
Jewish writers many were familiar with the works of Al-Khowa-
rizrni. Thus Abu Masar⁴ cites the tables of our author while
Abraham ben Esras· refers frequently to the same tables.

Three other Englishmen besides Aclelard of Bath are known to
have been students of Arabio mathematical science as taught in
the schools of Spain in the twelfth century. The names and
dates, as given by Wallis‚⁶ are : Adelard of Bath in 1130, Robertus
Retinensis in 1140, William Shelley (de Conchis) in 1145, and
Daniel Morley (Merlac) in 1180. This Robertus Retinensis⁷
was also known as Robertus Ketenensis, de Ketene, Ostiensis,
