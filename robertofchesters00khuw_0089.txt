MANUSCRIPTS OF ROBERT OF CHESTER'S TRANSLATION 63

ditur in the text of page 96, line 23, appears to be deliberate, as
the meaning of the passage is not clear. So, also, the omission in
the text of page 116, line 13, may have been deliberate, as the mul-
tiplication is a simple repetition of work which precedes.

Another difficulty in any exact determination of the genesis of
Scheybl's text is the fact that he had access to a copy of the alge—
bra of Al—Khowarizmi in the translation which we have designated
as the Libri text. The evidence of this familiarity is found in the
Acidim, written by Scheybl, which are printed on pages 128—156 of
this work, for herein are contained portions of the algebra which
were not translated by Robert of Chester, notably the problems
involving the square root of two hundred (pages 142-144).

Only a fragment remains of the Romain version, constituting
about 24 lines of our text. In this brief space there are some
twelve agreements with the Dresden and Vienna Mss„ and varia-
tions from the Scheybl text. However, one agreement with the
Scheybl manuscript shows either familiarity with Scheybl’s work,
or a common source other than the Vienna and Dresden Mss.
The title “Liber Algebrae et Almucabola, de quaestionibus arith-
meticis et geometricis ’' appears only in the Romain fragment and in
Scheybl's text; and somewhat similarly the word “creatori ” after
‘⁵ Laus deo '¹ in line lo. page 66, is common to the Romain version
and the other Mss except the Vienna Ms.

The fragment of our text in Codex Dresden C. Soffl, which we
have reproduced above, follows exactly none of the other texts.
Line omissions do not occur, but the spellings and transpositions
agree sometimes with the Vienna, sometimes with the Dresden
readings; in one instance m'l for nillil, the agreement is with the
Romain fragment as opposed to the Vienna and Dresden C. 80
readings. This fragment, then, appears also to be based on a
parent of the extant Mss.
