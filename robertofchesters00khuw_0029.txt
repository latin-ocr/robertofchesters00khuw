ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS BEFORE AL—KHOWARIZMI 11

of the equation,
ax²÷bx=c.

Contemporary with Al-Khowarizmi is the Hindu writer Mahavi-
racarya, whose arithmetical and algebraical work has been trans-
lated into English by M. Rangacarya.¹ Rules are given in the
sections devoted to algebra for the three types of complete quadratio
equations. A peculiarity of the treatment is that the unknown
quantity and the square root of the unknown appear, rather than
the unknown and its square. The significance of the work is
that it shows a persistence of interest in algebra in India from the
time of t—{ryabhata Three centuries later Bhaskara (b. 1114 A.D.),
another Hindu mathematician, made important contributions to
the advance of the science.

The brief survey which we have given of the study of algebra
before the time of Mohammed ibn Musa does not at all purpose
to present the sources from which the great Arab drew his inspi-
ration. Greece undoubtedly took mathematical ideas from Egypt,
as Rodet2 some years ago pointed out with reference to algebra.
Even more definite evidence is presented by the Greek use of
unit fractions as well as by the references to Egyptian mathe-
matics which were made by Plato and Herodotus, and much later
by Michael Psellus. Babylon and Greece were constantly exchang-
ing ideas;³ a striking proof of this is the Greek use of sexagesima]
fractions. India, too, was not out of touch with these neighbors
to her west. Especially in the fields of religion and the closely
associated astrology we have abundant evidence not only of inter-
change of ideas between the East and the West but also of the
recurrence in mediaeval times of ideas advanced by more ancient
civilizations. Yet we need to notice that we are dealing with
the independent appearances of algebraic ideas, and that the
mathematics of Egypt, Babylon, Clima, Greece, and India was
developing from within. Algebra is not, as often assumed, an
