When we multiply any side of this by a number (of numbers) ¹ it is evident
that that which results from the multiplicatiori will be a number of roots
equal to the root of the same number (of the
square). Since then ten roots were proposed
with the square, we take a fourth part of the
number ten and apply to each side of the
square an area of equidistant sides, of which
the length should be the same as the length
of the square first described and the breadth
ἡ, which is a fourth part of 10. Therefore
four areas of equidistant sides are applied to
the first square, α b. Of each of these the
length is the length of one root of the square FIG. 2—me the Columbia manu-

have just said. These now are the areas, c, d, e, s. There-
fore it follows from what we have said that there will be four
areas having sides of unequal length, which also are regarded
F1G-3-—Fr0m as unknown. The size of the areas in each of the four
ffinuslggeggen corners, which is found by multiplying 2} by ἡ, completes
that which is lacking in the larger or whole area. Whence
it is that we complete the drawing of the larger area by the addition of
the four products, each 2} by εξ ; the whole G
of this multiplicatiori gives 25.

And now it is evident that the first square
figure, which represents the square of the
unknown (ᾖ), and the four surrounding areas
(10 x) make 39. When we add 25 to this,
that is, the four smaller squares which indeed
are placed at the four angles of the square
a b, the drawing of the larger square. called
GH, is completed. Whence also the sum
total of this is 64, of which 8 is the root,

tract from eight twice the fourth part of 10, which is placed at the
extremities of the larger square G H, there will remain but 3. Five
being subtracted from 8, 3 necessarily remains, which is equal to one
side of the first square α Ζ).2

This three then expresses one root of the square figure, that is, one
root of the proposed square of the unknown, and 9 the square itself.
