26 INTRODUCTION

Astensis‚ or Cestrensis‚ the final form being the most common.
Retinensis (Retenensis) has been somewhat doubtfully referred to
Reading, England, while Cestrensis certainly refers to Chester.
Similar peculiarities in the dual or multiple designation of writers
have been noted in connection with the name of John of Spain;
such variations seem to have been common in this period. Robert
of chester, known to fame chiefly as the first translator of the
Qoran‚¹ was doubtless educated in the well-known school located
at Chester. Of the more personal side of Robert's life we have
but scattered facts. His nationality is established not only by
his name and his return to England in 1150, but also by the direct
statement made by Peter the Venerable in a letter² of 1143 con-
cerning the 901311, addressed to Bernard of Clairvaux. Peter
states in this letter that Robert was then archdeacon of Pampe-
luna, in northern Spain. Hermann the Dalmatian, commonly
known as Hermannus secundus, but also spoken of as Scho-
lasticus, Sclavus, or Chaldaeus, refers to Robert as his “special
and inseparable comrade, his peerless partner in every deed and
art.'⁷ In the year 1141 Robert and Hermann were living in
Spain near the Ebro, studying the arts of astrology. There in
that year Peter the Venerable found them and “by entreaty and
a good price '' induced them to take up studies in Mohammedan
religion and law, and also to translate the Qoran.3

⁸ As there is some question as to the real translator of the Qoran it seems desirable to
add from the 1550 edition of the Qoran the evidence that the translation is due to Robert,
