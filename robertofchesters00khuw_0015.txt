PREFACE

FROM the point of view of the history of science, no justification
is needed for the publication of a mathematical text of the twelfth
century, for the available material representing this period is
meagre. A wider acquaintance with Robert of Chester's Latin
translation of Al-Khowarizmi's Arabio treatise on algebra will per-
haps contribute to a more just estimate of the services rendered to
science by the Arabs. In the English version I have not at-
tempted to give a literal translation of the Latin, but rather to
express the thought in a phraseology which the modern student of
mathematics will find easy of comprehension; by consulting the
Latin text and footnotes the reader will be able to examine Robert
of Chester’s own words. For the convenience of readers interested
in the text Ι have added a Latin Glossaly in which are noted
many variations from the usage of classical writers. In the
Introduction I have presented a study of the significance of the
treatise in the history of mathematics, and a description of the
manuscripts upon which the text is based.

It is a pleasure to express indebtedness to Professor David
Eugene Smith for having suggested the work; to Mr. George A.
Plimpton for the generous use of his unique mathematical library;
to the librarians of the libraries of Vienna and Dresden for photo-
graphic reproductions of manuscripts containing this text; to the
librarian of Columbia University for the loan of the Scheybl man-
uscript, and to the librarian of the Cleveland Public Library
for the use ot works from the John G. White collection. I am
much indebted also to colleagues of the University of Michigan,
particularly in the Department of Latin and the Department of
Mathematics.

Ι am under special obligation to Mr. William H. Murphy for
making possible this publication.
