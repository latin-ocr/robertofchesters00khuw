48 INTRODUCTION

The inheritance problems occupy a large part of the original
work; the inclusion of one of these problems here will perhaps not
be 3111155. Only the first of the problems is given since the follow-
ing problems are of the same general nature, involving other legal

peculiarities.

“A man dies, leaving two sons behind him, and bequeathing one-third of his
capital to a stranger. He leaves ten (1111161115 of property and a claim of ten dirhems

upon one of the sons.
“ Computation : You call the sum which is taken out os the debt thing. Add this

to the capital which is ten dirhems. The sum 15 ten and thing. Subtract one-third
of this, since he has bequeathed one-third of his property, that 15, three dirhems and
one-third of thing. The remainder 15 six (1111161115 (and two-thirds) and two-thirds
of thing. Divide this between the two sons. The portion of each of thern is three
(1111161115 and one-third plus one-third of thing. This 15 equal to the thing which was
sought for. Reduce it⁷ by removing one-third from thing, on account of the other
third of thing. There remain two—thirds of thing, equal to three (1111161115 and one-
third. It 15 then only required that you complete the thing, by adding to it as much
35 one-half of the same; accordingly, you add to three and one-third 35 11111611 as
one-half of thern: This gives five (1111161115, which is the thing that 15 taken out of
the debts.¹⁷

The legal point involved in the problern given 15 that a son who
owes to the estate of his father an amount greater than the son’s
portion of the estate, retains, in any event, the whole sum which he
owes. Part 15 regarded as 1115 511316 of the estate, and the re-
mainder 35 a gift from the father. The above problem would have
given exactly the 531116 numerical results for any debt from five
(111-1161115 up; however, if there were a claim of four 61111161115 against
one of the sons, instead of ten, the debtor son would have received
in 63511 ξ of one (111-116111, the other son four and ξ 61111161115, and the
stranger four and ξ (1111161115.

111 algebraical symbolism, the equation 15 ξ (Io-l-x) = 2x
whence x = 5; lo -i— xis the total estate left, and x 15 the share
of each son.
