work, mentioning the fact noted by Romain that the latter had
obtained an excellent manuscript copy of the algebra from his
friend Thaddeus Hagec of Prague. I arn indeed fortunate,
through the courtesy of Professor Bosmans and of Professor B.
Lefebvre of Louvain, to be able to include this fragment in my
collation. Another fragment in ΜΞ was found after the textual
notes were in type; this brief portion from Codex Dresdensis C.
80¹⁶, of the fifteenth or sixteenth century, is included later in this
chapter.

Yet another fragment of the algebra was published by Wappler)
who did not, however, ascribe the passage to Robert of Chester.
The failure to connect it directly with the algebra in the same
manuscript elsewhere mentioned by Wappler was due in part to
the fact that the section in question, which is found p. 120, l. 21 to p.
124, l. 16 of our text, is not in its proper place in the Dresden
manuscript. The same paragraphs are found also in a manuscript
of the University Library at Leipzig, Codex Lips. 1470. I
am indebted for information concerning this manuscript to the
courtesy of Director Boysen and Dr. Helssig, of the Univer-
sity Library in Leipzig. It appears that this manuscript is
almost entirely from the hand of Magister Virgilius &Vellendorfer
of Leipzig, written during his student days, between the years
1481 and 1487. The passage referred to was in all probability
copied from the Dresden Codex C. 80. Apparently Wellendorfer
had the intention of copying the algebra entire, for on folio 478²
we find the title, T extus a4'gabre edidit Malzume Mosz‘ filius. To
the title he added a brief note, Sed utitur aliis nominibus . . .
substantia et dragma, radicis . . . algorithmi. These words
clearly indicate some acquaintance with our text, but the text
itself is not found in the manuscript.

The Scheybl MS. (C.)‚ written in 1550, was evidently intended
for publication. In printing Robert of Chester⁷s text I have
thought it best to follow the Ms. which was prepared by Scheybl.
Although it contains some errors‚ and slight additions by
Scheybl, these are quite easily distinguished. The advantage of
following Scheybl's careful revision seemed obvious; particularly
the chapter divisions and sub-tides, many of which he supplied,
