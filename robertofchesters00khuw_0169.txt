ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 139

the articles, or both negative, then the fourth product is positive. If, how-
ever, one term in one binomial is positive and the other corresponding term
is negative then this product should be subtracted from the other products.

There F ollows an I llustration of this Rule

To multiply 8 by 17 is the same as to multiply 10 less 2 by 20 less 3, and
it will be done in this way. Multiply 10 by 20, giving 2003 then multiply
negative 2 by 20, giving 40, which subtracted from 200 leaves 160; in the
third place multiply 10 by negative 3, giving 30, which subtracted from 160
leaves 130; in the fourth place multiply negative 2 by negative 3, giving
positive 6, which being added gives 136. Therefore 8 times 17 gives 136.

The calculation follows: 10 — 2

20-Ξ

200 - 40

— ΞΟ -1- 6
136, etc.
Positives by negatives you subtract, but other products you add. When
roots are equal to both number and squares⁷ the half (is multiplied by the
half) and you subtract, otherwise you add that which you obtain.¹

Three other lines of verse which illustrate the three types os equations.

A square and 8 roots equal 33.

A square together with 6 equals 5 roots.

Four roots and 12 are equal to a square.

Suppose you are to multiply 10 by 10 less x.

Multiply 10 by 10, giving 100. Then multiply 10 by (negative) x„ giving
negative 10 x. Hence the product is 100 units less 10 x.

Second. Suppose you are to multiply 10 by 10 plus x.

Multiply 10 by 10 and by x, giving 100 units and 10 x.

Third. Suppose you are to multiply 10 plus x by 10 plus x.

Multiply 10 by 10, giving 100. Then multiply x by 10, giving positive
10 x. Thirdly, multiply 10 by x. giving positive 10 x. Fourthly. multiply
x by x, giving positive x2. Hence the product is 100 units, 20 x and x2.

Fourth. Suppose you are to multiply 10 less x by 10 less x.

Multiply 10 by 10⁷ giving 100. Then multiply negative x by 10, giving
negative 10 x. The total, so far, is 100 less 10 x. Thirdly, multiply 10
by negative x, giving negative 10 x, or, in all, 100 less 20 x. Fourthly,
multiply negative x by negative x, giving x² positive. The final product will
be 100 units, and x² less 20 x.

¹ These verses are somewhat obscure. The meaning probably is that in the type x² ψ n = bx
the number is subtracted from the square 01 half the coefficient 01 x, whereas in the other two
types 01 complete quadratics you subtract the number from this square.
