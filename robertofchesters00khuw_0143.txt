THE BOOK OF ALGEBRA AND ALMUCABOLA 113

The explanation of this problem is of the following nature: you multiply
10 — x by its equal‚ which gives 100 -ὶ- x² — 20:25. Also you multiply
x by x, giving x2, which you add to 100 —†- x² - 20 x. This gives
100 † 2 x² — 20 x. To the sum total now add the difference between
the two parts, 10 — 2x‚ and this total amounts to 110 -Ι- 2 x² - 22 x,
which equals 54 units. You complete therefore (by adding 22 x), and you
obtain 110 units -Ι- 2 x2 equal to 54 units -l- 22 x. This, moreover‚ you
reduce to one square, giving 55 units —†- x² equal to 27 units -4- 11 x. So
subtract 27 from 55, giving 28 units 4- x² equal to 11 x. Halve the un-
knowns, giving 53. Multiply this by itself, giving 30} From this subtract
28 and the root of the remainder, 13, taken from one-half of the roots, will
leave 4. Therefore this represents one part.

F ourtlt Problem ¹

Divide ten into two parts in such a way that the product of one part by
itself equals 81 times the other part.²

Explanation: you multiply 10 — x by itself, giving 100 ÷ x² — 20 x,
which equals 81 x. Complete 100 ψ x² by adding 20x to 81 x. This
gives 100 ÷ x² equa] to 101 x. You halve the unknowns, giving 503.
Multiply this by itself, giving 2550} Now subtract 100 from it, leaving
2450} Take the root of this, i.e. 493. and subtract it from the half of
the roots. This will give unity⁷ representing one part of ten.³

F i stlz Problem

Two squares (i.e. two quantities or numbers) being given with a difference
of two units, I divide the smaller by the larger in such a way that the
fraction resulting from the division shall equal one-half.⁴

¹ The order of the problems is from this point different from the order of the corresponding
set of problems as given in the Libri, Arabic, and Boncompagni versions, but the variations are
due to the omission of problems, as will be noted below, rather than to actual changes in order.
See chapter V οἱ our Introduction. The Boncompagni text is the least complete, giving only
ten problems, which follow, in the main, those of the Libri text.

² This problem (10 - x)² = 81 x, appears on pages 47—48 of Rosen's book, and appears twice
in the Libri text, pp. 282—283 and pp. 289—290.

In modern notation, the solution proceeds:

100 - 20:1¹ ÷x² = 81 ,η .τῖ ÷ 100= 101 .τ; {of 101 is 5οὲ, (5οὲ)2 = 2550}; 2550} — 100

 

= 2440}; 42440} = 493 ; 50} — 49ss = 1, which is the value of one root. The other root would
be 50} 4- 493, or 100.

³The second root, 100, is not given, since it leads to 100 and negative 90 as the two
parts into which 10 is divided. This was rejected by the Arabic writer as an impossible
solution, nor, indeed, was such a solution regarded as possible for centuries after the time oi
the Arab.

⁴ Rosen, pp. 50—51‚ and again pp. 62-63; Libri, p. 283 and p. 295. By error Scheybl makes
this one-half of the larger square.
