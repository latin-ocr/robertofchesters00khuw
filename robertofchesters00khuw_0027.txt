ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS BEFORE AL—KHOWARIZLH 9

The discussion leads to the inequality, 2 7722 > 6 m-l— 18, which,
since only integral solutions are desired, explains the use of 7 as
the approximate square root of 45, in the following paragraph:

“ When we solve such an equation, we multiply half the coefficient ofx into itself,—-
this gives 9, —then multiply the coefficient of ,εἳ into the units, — 2 · 18:36, — add
this last number to the 9, making 45, and take the side [square root] of 45, which
is not less than 7; add half the coefficient of .t‚—making a number not less than
10‚— and divide the result by the coefficient of .t²; the result is not less than 5.”

Of the second type, ax2÷c=b22 Diophantus gives several illus-
trations, requiring frequently only the approximate value of the
root. Problems of this kind are the following:

72 m > 17 7722 -l- 17, m not greater than ξ-ξ, (V. io)
19 m² -1- 19 > 72 m, m not less than »ξ-ξ, (V. 10)
7722 ÷ 60 > 22 m, m not less than 19, (V. 30)
772² 4- 60 < 24 m, m not greater than 21, (V. 30)
and 172x= 336x‘24-24, (V1.22>

of which the statement is made that the root is not rational, ancl in
the same problem
78848x2—8432x4 225 =o‚

which has the rational root {²1⁵3-

Commentaries on the Arz'tlmzetica began to appear very early.
Probably the most interesting commentary from the modern point
of view was the one written in the late fourth or early fifth cen—
tury by Hypatia, the daughter of Theon of Alexandria. Unfortu-
nately her writings are all lost, although there is ground for the
beliefl that some remarks made by Michael Psellus (eleventh
century) concerning Egyptian arithmetic ancl algebra were based
on her commentary. She came naturally by her mathematical
ability; her father Theon wrote a commentary on Ptolemy's
Almagest and makes in this the earliest known reference to
Diophantus.

Cossali,2 writing in 1797 on the history of algebra‚ conjectures
that the step from the geometrical to the analytical form of solu-
tion took place in the period between Euclid and Diophantus.
