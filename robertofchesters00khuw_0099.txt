are composed of these three kinds: namely, roots, squares ¹ and numbers.
However number alone is connected neither with roots nor with squares by
any ratio. Of these then the root is anything composed of units which can
be multiplied by itself, or any number greater than unity multiplied by
itself : or that which is found to be diminished below unity when multiplied
by itself. The square is that which results from the multiplication of a
root by itself.

Of these three forms, then, two may be equal to each other, as for

example ;
Squares equal to roots,

Squares equal to numbers, and
Roots equal to numbers.2

CHAPTER I

C oncernz'ng §quares equal to roots ³

The following is an example of squares equal to roots: a square is equal
to 5 roots. The root of the square then is 5, and 25 forms its square which,
of course, equals five ot its rootsst

Another example: the third part of a square equals four roots. Then
the root of the square is 12 and 144 designates its square.5 And similarly,
five squares equal 10 roots. Therefore one square equals two roots and the
root of the square is 2. Four represents the square.⁶

In the same manner then that which involves more than one square, or
is less than one, is reduced to one square. Likewise you perform the same
operation upon the roots which accompany the squares.

CHAPTER ΙΙ

Concerning squares equal to numbers³

Squares equal to numbers are illustrated in the following manner: a
square is equal to nine. Then nine measures the square of which three
represents one root.⁷

Whether there are many or few squares they will have to be reduced in
the same manner to the form of one square. That is to say, if there

of the unknown. Gerard of Cremona used census, which has a similar meaning.

² These are the three types designated as ‘simple ' by Omar al-Khayyami, Al-Karkhi, and
Leonard of Pisa. They correspond in modern algebraic notation to the following:

ιιι-2 = bx, ιιι-2 = n, and bx = n.
