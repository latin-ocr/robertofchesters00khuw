ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS BEFORE AL—KHOWARIZMI 5

“ For let the square ABDC be described on AB (I. 46),· let AC be bisected at
the point E, and let BE be joined 3 let CA be drawn through to F, and let EF be
made equal to BE 3 let the square FH be described on AF, and let GH be drawn
through to K.

“ I say that AB has been cut at H so as to make the rectangle contained by AB,
BH equal to the square on AH.

‘¹ For, since the straight line AC has been bisected at E, and FA is added to it,
the rectangle contained by CF, FA together with the square οι] AE is equa} to the
square on EF. (ΙΙ. 6.)

“But EF is equal to EB; therefore the rectangle CF, FA together with the
square on ΑΕ is equal to the square on EB.

· “But the squares on BA, ΑΕ are equal to the F
square on EB, for the angle at A is right (Ι. 47),-
therefore the rectangle CF, FA together with the
square on AE is equal to the §quares on BA, AE.

“ Let the square on AE be subtracted from
each; therefore the rectangle CF, FA which re-
mains is equal to the square on AB.

“ Now the rectangle CF, FA is FK, for AF is
equal to FG ; and the square on AB is AD 5
therefore FK is equal to AD.

“ Let AK be subtracted from each; therefore Ε
FH which remains is equal to HD.

“ And HD is the rectangle AB, BH, sor AB is
equal to BD; and FH is the square on AH3
therefore the rectangle contained by AB, BH is
equal to the square on HA.

 

“Therefore the given straight line AB has been cut at H so as to make the
rectangle contained by AB, BH equal to the square on HA. Q. E. F.'‘

The ordinary algebraical solution of the corresponding equation
x2 -†- ax: αἳ, from a(a — x) = 96²,
parallels this geometrical demonstration.

To complete the square in the left-hand member, ai is added to

both members. This corresponds to marking the point E on the

figure, for then the square on BE equals α]2 4-{3 or AB2÷ AE2.

Extracting the square root of both members, we have, alge-
braically, χ-ΉΞ = -ὓ- &fisus

the negative sign being disregarded. The right-hand member
corresponds to the line BE and the left-hand member to EF,
which is equal to BE.
