Similar multiplications of nodes‚¹ illustrated by things or roots and
numbers, follow. In the same manner the unknowns ² are multiplied by
themselves, either when numbers added to them, or when numbers are sub-
tracted from thern, or when they are to be subtracted from numbers. For
example, to multiply x -4- 10 by x ÷ 10y you proceed thus: x by x, x‘2, and x
multiplied by 10 gives 10 x; also 10 by x, 10 x, and 10 multiplied by 10 gives
100. The sum total is then x‘2, 20 x, and 100.³

Another example: multiply x by x. Yon say that x by x gives x2, and
this is the product of the multiplication.

Similarly, x — 10 by x — 10: x by x gives x2 and negative 10 by x gives
negatlve 10 x. Also negative4 10 by x gives 10 x negative, and negative 10
by negative 10 gives positive 100. Whence the total product of this multi-
plication amounts to x² less 20 x, with 100 to be added.³

Or also if you multiply 10 by 10, and again 10 - x by 10 - x: 10 multi-
plied by 10 gives 100; so much is the product of the first multiplication.
Then, 10 multiplied by 10 gives positive 1003 negative x by 10, 10 x nega-
tive; also 10 by negative x gives negative 10 x; negative x by negative x
gives positive x2. Whence the total product of the second multiplicatiori
extends to 100 less 20 x, with x2 to be added.

Again‚ if you try to find the product of 10 ψ x multiplied by its equal you
proceed thus: 10 by 10, 1003 and x by 10 gives 10x; also 10 by x, 10 x, and
x by x gives x2. The total product amounts to 100, 20 x and x‘2.

Now if you try to find the product of either 10 — x by 10 or 10 —l- x by
10, the first product is 100 — 10 x and the other 100 -4- 10 x.

Further some one may ask. how much is the product of 10 — x by 10 -ι- x?
You proceed thus : 10 by 10, 100 units, and negative x by 10 gives negative
10 x; also 10 by x gives 10 x positive, and negative x by x gives negative x2.
This total then equals 100 units less x‘·'.³

Another problem : 10 — x by x. You proceed thus: 10 by x gives 10 x,
and negative x by x gives x² to be subtracted. This then equals 10 x less x2.

¹ See p. 91, footnote 2.

² Res (literally ‘thing') is used in such a technical sense that it seems better to translate
by ‘unknoxvn‚' as in this instance, or by x· as in much of the following work.

³ Scheybl adds to this, and to two problems below, the following calculation forms which ap-
proach the modern symbolism for the product of binomials. Scheybl prefaces with the words,
‘as follows,' or ⁸ the calculation follows ’z

Scheybl uses 100 N here for the number 100, following the notation employed by himin his printed
works on algebra as well as in the algebra text which is found in the same manuscript with this
version of Robert of Chester.

⁴ In the Latin text (l. 11) Scheybl has res cum re instead of sine zo cum re.
