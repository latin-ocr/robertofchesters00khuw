CHAPTER II

AL-KHOWARIZMI AND Hls TREATISE ΟΝ ALGEBRA

THE activity of the great Arabic mathematician Abu ‘Abdallah
Mohammed ibn Musa al-Khowarizmi marks the beginning of that
period of mathematica] history in which analysis assumed a place
on a level with geometry; and his algebra gave a definite form to
the ideas which we have been setting forth. The arithmetic of
Al-Khowarizmi made known to the Arabs and, through an early
twelfth-century translation, to Europeans also, the Hindu art of
reckoning. Any consideration of the difficulties attending arith-
metical operations with the Greek letter 111111161315,1 01· even with
the Roman numerals, shows how essential the adoption of numer-
als with place value was for the development of the analytical
side of mathematicsz the way was being prepared also for the
appearance of decimal fractions, many centuries later, and for
logarithms, both indispensable tools of modern science. Quite as
important as the arithmetic for the development of mathematics
was the systematic treatise on algebra2 which Mohammed ibn
Musa gave to the world. This is the work of which we present
the Latin translation made by Robert of Chester while living in
Segovia in 1183 of the Spanish Era (1145 Α.1).).3

Our chief source of information in regard to the life and the
writings of our Arabic author is the Book of Cllmm'cles‘* (Kitab

¹ Nine letters represent the units from 1 to 9, nine further letters the tens from 10 to 90,
and nine others the hundreds. The thousands up to 900,000 are represented by the same
letters with a kind of accent mark.

was published with English translation by Frederic Rosen. lee Algcbra as Molmmmed

on Rosen's Arabic text, Nouvclles Annales de Alatln'wmtsques, Vol. 5 (1846), pp. 557—581,
and also later revised in Annali di illalemat.. Vol. VII (1866), pp. 268-280.

³ A preliminary note by the author concerning this translation appeared in the Bih-
lz‘ollzcca Alathemallsa, third series, Vol. XI (1911), pp. 125—131, with the title, Robcrt of

⁴ The Kstab al-Fz‘lzrist was edited with notes by G. Fliigel and published after Professor
Fliigel’s death by J. Roediger and A. Mueller (Leipzig, 1871—1872). I quote from the
German translation by H. Suter, Das Mzztlzemaliker- Verseiclmiss im Filzrist, Abltandlmrgten
