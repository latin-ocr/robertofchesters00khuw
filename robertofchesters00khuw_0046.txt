as an authority on Mohammedan customs. A further manuscript
referencel seems to indicate that in the year 1136 Robert was
studying in Barcelona with Plato of Tivoli, while Fabricius2 states,
but upon what authority does not appear, that Robert travelled in
Italy, Greece‚ and Spain. The time and the place of Robert's
death are equally uncertain.

To Peter the Venemble, Abbot of Cluny‚ who induced Robert
to undertake the translation of the Qoran, the latter addressed a
Saracenic chronicle, Chronica mendosa el ridiculosa Saracenorum?
which was published in 1550 with the Qoran. Other names have
been connected with this translation of the Qoran, but a study of
Peter's letters, and the introduction to Peter‘s treatise, “Against
the Sect of the Saracens‚'’4 shows that Robert and Hermann were
definitely requested to undertake the translation, which it appears
from Robert's preface was finally completed by Robert alone.
Possibly Peter of Toledo made an earlier,5 unsatisfactory transla-
tion of the same work. A Mohammedan by the name of
Mohammed was engaged by Peter the Venerable to scrutinize
the various ‘'creatises with a view to correcting errors due to
mistranslation.

Of Robert's works the version of the Qoran was completed in
1143. In a prefatory letter he states that this task was regarded
by him only as a digression from his principa] studies of as-
tronomy and geometry,6 but posterity knew of him through the

Robert and Hermann. In the letter to Bernhard of Clairvaux Peter says z ⁴* Mitto vobis,

on Arabic customs.
