product of one part by the other. Then multiply x by x, i.e. one part by
itselL giving x2, which equals 40x - 4 x2. Therefore restore ¹ or complete
the number, i.e. add four squares to one square, and you obtain five squares
equa} to 40 x. Hence 8 is the root of the square which itself is 64. The root
of this is that part of 10 which is to be multiplied by itself‚ and the difference
between this number and ten is 2. So that 2 is the other part of 10. Now
this problem has led you to one of the six chapters² and, indeed, to that one
in which we treat the type, squares equal to roots.

Second problem, illustrating the second chapter

I divide 10 into two parts in such a way that the product of 10 by itself
is equal to twice the product of one part by itself⁷ adding seven-ninths of the
same product.³

Explanation. You multiply 10 by itself, giving 100, which is equal to 2x2
and gx? You reduce this to one square, i.e. to ἐς, equal to ὲ and ἓ of ὲ
of itself. And so reduce ὲ and ξ of ἑ of 100, i.e. 36, to one square. The
root of the square is 6, representing one part of the division of 10, whence
then the other part is necessarily 4. Therefore this problem has led you
to the second of the six chapters in which we treated the type, squares equal
to numbers.

Third problem, illustrating the third chapter

I divide 10 into two parts in such a way that when one part is divided by
the other, the resulting fraction equals 4.4

Explanation. You let x represent one part, and consequently the other
you propose as 10 — x. Then you divide 10 — x by x, giving 4. Now
it is evident that if you multiply the quotient by the divisor you

¹ This is strictly the operation corresponding to the term algebra, and the verb used in the
Arabic text is in fact from the same stem jbr as the word ¹ algebra ' ; the quantity 40 x above is
regarded as incomplete by the amount 4 1²².

² The reference is to the six types οἱ quadratic equations which are discussed extensively in the
first part of the work, namely,

ιιι-2 = br, ιιι-2 -4- bx = n,
ax² = n, α.ϊῖ -†- n = bx,
ar = n, affl = bx 4- n.

The first six of the problems in this set are chosen to illustrate each of these six types, in order.

³ 225² -4-{x2 = 100; ²15⁵-x2 = 100; x² = 36 anda· = ὁ.

The Arabic text οἱ this problem is somewhat lengthier, and includes the statement of a
second problem which does not appear either in our text or in the Libri version. Following
Rosen’s translation, op. cit.‚ p. 36: ⁴¹1 have divided ten into two portions: I have multiplied
each of the parts by itself, and afterwards ten by itself: the product of ten by itself is equal to
one of the two parts multiplied by itself, and afterwards by two and seven-ninths; or equal to
the other multiplied by itself and afterwards by six and one-fourth.” But a solution is given
only for the first part of the problem.

=4; 10 —x =4x; 10 =5x‚andx =2.
