20 INTRODUCTION

of Abu Kamil's algebra. Two of these commentaries on Abu
Karnil's work appeared in the tenth century and are listed in the
Fihrist. The Persian Al-Istakhri,1 known as The Reckoner‚ was
the author of one, and ‘Ali ibn Ahmed al-‘Irnrani ² wrote the other.
Neither commentary has come down to us. The author of the
Latin translation upon which rny study is based is not known, but
the probability is that the translation was made about the time of
Gerard of Cremona. Another connnentary of uncertain date in
Arabic by a Mohammedan Spaniard‚ Al-Khoreshi, is probably of
later origin. In the fifteenth century a Hebrew translation was
prepared by Mordechai Finzi of Mantua (about 1475); this is of
especial interest since it bears internal evidence, in the termi-
nology employed, that it was based upon a Spanish original. The
author of the Spanish treatise‚ doubtless a Christian, is unknown.
Ibn Khaldun mentions the commentary written by Al-Khoreshi,
but no trace has yet been found of either Spanish translation or
commentary. A unique copy of the Latin translation of the
algebra is in Paris (Mss. Lat. 7377 A) and copies of the Hebrew
translation are found in Paris and Munich.3

The widespread interest among Arabic scientists in the study
of algebra is attested by the number of works upon the subject.
Even as early as the tenth century besides Al-Khowarizmi there
were three other writers4 of sufficient prominence to warrant
their appearance in the Fihrist. Abu ‘Otnian Sahl ibn Bishr. ibn
Habib ibn Hani, a Jew, wrote an algebra which Al-Nadim states
was praised by the Romans, and Ahmed ibn Da'ud, Aba Hanifa,
al-Dinawari (d. 895 A.D.) and Abu Yusuf al—Missisi also wrote
treatises on the subject. These works are preserved only in
title. In the thirteenth century Ibn al-Banna‚5 including in his
arithmetic a brief exposition of algebra, employs the title,
“algebra and almucabala,’' as given by Al-Khowarizrni, and
follows the same peculiar order of the six types of quadratic
equationS. Al-Banna adds no numerical illustrations but states
