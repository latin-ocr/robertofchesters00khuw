Algebraically we proceed by subtracting Ξ from both members‚

giving x= Τ - {⁶

This corresponds to the line AF in the figure which is
BE — Α E.

Analytical solution of the quadratio equation appears quite
definitely in the works of Heron of Alexandria, who flourished
about the beginning of the Christian Era. Heron states in effect
that given the sum of two line segments and their product then
each of the segments is known.l However, he goes farther than
any work of Euclid in applying this to a numerical example,

144 x(14 —x)=6720.

Without putting this into the form of an equation‚ Heron states γ
that the approximate value ofx is 82—5, and this evidently indicates
an analytical solution. The geometrical garb is absolutely clis-
carded in a problem in the Geomelry doubtfully attributed to
Heron.2 The problem is to compute the diameter of a circle
given the sum of the area, the circumference, and the diameter,
summing an area and lengths, entirely contrary to Greek usage.

Somewhat similar problems3 in which lines and areas are
summed appear in Greece in the period between Heron and
Diophantus (about 250 A.D.) as well as in the works of the
latter. One of these problems is to find a square whose area and
perimeter together equal 896 (x‘2-l-4x=896). The solution pro-
