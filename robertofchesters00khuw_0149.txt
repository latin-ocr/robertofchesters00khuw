T welfth Problem

I divide a unit and 0116-11311 111 such a way that the larger part shall be
double the smaller.¹

Explanation. I let the greater part be to the lesser as one is to x ; whence
Ι say divide 1} units by one unit —{- x, giving 2 x. Therefore I multiply
2 x by one unit -l- x, giving 2 x² -l- 2 x, which is equal to 1} units. Ι reduce
this, therefore, to one square, that is, of each thing I take the half. Ι say
then that x2 4- x is equal to Ξ 01 3 111111. You now proceed in the manner
which we have explained.

T lzirteentlz Problem ²

Ι multiply a square by two-thirds 01 115611 and have five as a product.³

Explanation. Ι multiply x by two-thirds x. giving }x²‚ which equals
five. Complete ξ x² by adding to it one-half of 115611, and one x² is obtained.
Likewise add to five one-half 01 115611, and you have γὲ, which equals x2.
The root of 11115, 111611, 15 1116 number which when multiplied by two-thirds
of itself gives five.

F ourteentlz Problem

I divide a unit among girls in such a way that each one receives the same
fractional part 01 1116 thing. Now 11 Ι add one girl to the number, each
receives for her part one-sixth (01 3 111111) 1655 111311 1161016.4

Explanation. I multiply the number 01 girls at the first by the fractional
part representing the difference. Then Ι multiply this product by the
second number 01 girls⁷ and finally I divide this product by the difference
between the first and second number 01 girls. This completes the given
quantity.⁵ Hence I multiply in this instance one x, representing the first
number 01 girls, by the difference between the two amounts, ὲ, and ὲκ 15
obtained. Then Ι multiply this product by the second number 01 girls,
which 15 1 —l— x, and }x² —†- ὲ x is obtained; this being divided by a unit
equals a unit. I complete the square, that is, I multiply the square by six,
and I have x² 4- x. Likewise I multiply the unit by six 1111115, giving x² -l— x

¹ strictly, Ιὲ - x = 2 x, whence x = ὲ. The English translation 0111115 problem is adapted by
Rosen (p. 59) to conform to the solution in the explanation, and this follows closely our explana-

Ι 3111 indebted to Professor W. H. Worrell for the following precise translation 01 the Arabic
text of the passage: “If it is said to divide a unit and a half between a man and a part 01 3 111311,
111611 1116 man has received the like of the fraction.'' The Libri text, pp. 285—286‚ varies from
this only in stating that the man receives double that which the fractional part (of a man) receives.
