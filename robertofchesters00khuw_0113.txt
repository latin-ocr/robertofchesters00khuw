which proves to be one side of the square a b, that is, one root of the pro-
posed x2. Therefore three is the root of this 25², and x¹2 is 9.

CONCERNING A SQUARE AND UNJTs EQUAL To UNKNOWN QUANTITLES

A square and 21 units are equal to ten unknowns. This proposition or
problem was proposed in the fifth chapter and here a geometrical
demonstration is presented.

Suppose that the square α b, α
having unknown sides, represents
x² and apply to it a rectangu-
lar parallelogram of which the
breadth is equal to one side of
the square a b and the length is 7² b ⁰ d
any quantity you please} Then FIG. 7.—Incornplete figure. lfrom the Columbia

tangle is 21. which number accompanies the same x‘3. Moreover this area
b Z'c 9 or rectangle is called bg, of which one side is g d and the

f 9

length os the two areas together is finally h d. And it

is now evident that this length represents 10⁷ since every

3³ αἳ ‘³ y d quadrilateral having right angles (every square) gives for

Pltofieg'ffissssoeng the product of one of its sides by unity one root, and if
manuscript. multiplied by two gives two roots of its area.

Therefore since the problem was given„ 2⁶² and 21 units equal 10 roots‚ it
is evident that the length of the side lz d is 10. for the side lz b designates one
root of x2. Thereiore bisect the side lz d at the point e 3 so that the line e lz
is equal to the line e d. From the point e draw the perpendicular e t. This
perpendicular equals lz α. Add to the prolongation of the line e t a part e c
equal to the amount by which it is less than d e and then t c will equal t g.
Whence we arrive at the square t l which is the product of half of the roots
multiplied byitself. that is the product. in this instance, of 5 and 5. More-
over we know that the area b g which we add to x² amounts to 21. Therefore
we cut across the area b g with the line t e, which is one side of the area t l,
and thus decrease the area b g by the amount of the area b t. Then we form

² If the lettering of this figure is made to conform to that of our text the demonstration will be
seen to be not materially different3 it is based more directly on Euclid ΙΙ, 5. This proposition,
following Heathv les leirtccu Books of Euslid's Elcmcnts, reads as follows: ‘¹ If a straight line
be cut into equal and unequal segments, the rectangle contained by the unequal segments oi the
whole together with the square on the straight line between the points of section is equal to the
square on the half.'' This is one oi the propositions of Euclid which connect very directly with
the geometrical solution of the quadratic equation.
