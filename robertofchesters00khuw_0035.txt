AL-KHOWARIZMI AND HIS TREATISE ΟΝ ALGEBRA 17

astronomy. Three of the books which deal particularly with
arithmetic have been published,l but no study has yet been made
of the three books on astronomy. The writer A. is supposed to
be Adelard of Bath, who was active at the tirne that this work
was written; he translated the tables of Al-Khowarizmi. So far
as these five books of the introduction are concerned, the work
may well be a summary of the elementary teachings of Al-Khow-
arizmi according to the unknown writer's conception of them.
Al-Mas‘udi (885—956 A.D.) in his Meadows of δοίιί2 mentions
Mohammed ibn Musa among the historians and chroniclers‚ bas-
ing his reference doubtless on the Book of Clzronology above men-
tioned. Al-Biruni (973-1048 A.D.), whose work on India3 has
recently (1910) appeared in a second English edition, refers to
the tables and the astronomical work of our author. No less
than three works by Al-Biruni 4 are explanatory of works written
by the distinguished mathematician and astronomer who was his
fellow-countryman‚ both being from Khowarizm (or Khiva).
Not only in the fields of astronomy, chronology, and mathematics
did Mohammed ibn Musa achieve fame, but also as a geographer.
His contribution in this field has been set forth by Nallino, who
states, by way of conclusion to his article on Al-Klzowam·2mz' and
lzz's reconstrzcction of tlae geography of Ptolemy,⁵ that this geog-
raphy is not a servile imitation of the Greek model, but an elabo-
ration of Ptolemaic material made with more independence and
ability than is displayed by any European writer of that period.
The trigonometric tables, in Latin translation by Adelard of Rath,
appear to be the earliest of Al-Khowarizmi’s works to be known
in Europe, and indeed one of the earliest mathematical treatises
taken from the Arabic; it was translated in 1126 A.D. A study
