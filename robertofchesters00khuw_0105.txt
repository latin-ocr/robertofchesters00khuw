fore take one—half of the roots, giving 5, which multiplied by itself produces
25. Add this to 56, making 81. Extract the square root of this total, which
gives 9, and from this subtract half of the roots, 5, leaving 4 as the root of the
square.

In this manner you should perform the same operation upon all squares,
however many of them there are, and also upon the roots and the units.

CHAPTER V

Concerning squares and numbers equal to roots

The following is an illustration of this type: a square and 21 units
equal 10 roots.l The rule for the investigation of this type of equation
is as follows: what is the square which is such that when you add 21
units the sum total equals 10 roots of that square? The solution of this
type of problem is obtained in the following manner. You take first one-
half of the roots, giving in this instance 5, which multiplied by itself gives
25. From 25 subtract the 21 units to which we have just referred in
connection with the squares. This gives 4, of which you extract the square
root, which is 2. From the half of the roots, or 5, you take 2 away, and 3
remains‚ constituting one root of this square which itself is, of course, 9.2

If you wish you may add to the half of the roots, namely 5, the same 2
which you have just subtracted from the half of the roots. This give 7,
which standsfor one root of the square, and 49 completes the square.³ There-
fore when any problem of this type is proposed to you, try the solution of it
by addition as we have said. If you do not solve it by addition, without
doubt you will find it by subtraction. And indeed this type alone requires
both addition and subtraction, and this you do not find at all in the preceding
types.⁴

You ought to understand also that when you take the half of the roots
in this form of equation and then multiply the half by itself⁷ if that which
proceeds or results from the multiplication is less than the units above-
mentioned as accompanying the square, you have no equation.⁵ If equal

¹ x² ÷ 21 = xo x. For this type of equation both solutions are presented since both roots are
positive. A negative number would not be accepted as a solution by the Arabs of this time,
nor indeed were they fully accepted until the time of Descartes,

² For the general type, 1² -†- n = bx the solution is x = ἒ ss xl (ΞΥ - η, and both positive and

negative values of the radical give positive solutions of the equation proposed. In this problem
we have x²÷ 21 = 10 .=·; ὲ of 10 is 5, 5² is 25, 25 - 21 = 4,
xl} = 2; 5— 2 =3,0ne root; 5÷2 = 7, theotherroot.
³ Another use of the expression, ‘⁵ completing the square.’'
⁴ The Vienna MS. defines, ‘in which the roots are halved.'
⁵ This corresponds to the condition, b² - 4ac < ο, in the equation ax² ÷bx ÷c = 03
in this event the roots are imaginary.
