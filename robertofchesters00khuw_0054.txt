36 INTRODUCTION

manuscript is given in the Rara Arz'tlmzetz'ca‚¹ but the somewhat
extensive treatment of algebra is not mentioned.

The first work in the German language on algebra was an
excerpt from Al-Khowarizmi which begins:2 “ Mohammed in the
book of algebra and almucabala has spoken these words ‘census
radix (root), and number.'‘' This is followed by two problems
from the text. The manuscript which contains this brief dis-
cussion, of date 1461, is now in Munich‚ having been moved
from the Benedictine Abbey of St. Emmeran. The first treat-
ment in the English language appears to be that by Robert
Recorde‚ Tlce leetslone of [Vitta which was published in
1557. This work which, as I have elsewhere shown,3 does
not display any marked originality on the part of Recorde, intro-
duced our present symbol of equalsty, =, and contributed to the
study of algebra in England by presenting the material in the
mother tongue.

Regiomontanus seems to have been familiar with Al-Kho-
warizmi's work, for he not only refers to the art of thing and
square (ars reiet census), but also uses certain technical expres-
sions, reslaurare daseclus, for example, similar to those in the
algebra. A manuscript copy4 of Mohammed ibn Musa‘s algebra
in Mr. Plimpton’s collection shows astonishing similarity to the
handwriting and abbreviations of Regiomontanus as well as to
the form of equation used by the great German. Furthermore‚
some of the problems given in this manuscript, which are not
part of Al-Khowarizmi's text, are discussed by Regiomontanus in
his correspondence with Cardinal Blanchinus.5 We must sup-
pose him to have been familiar with this text if not actually, as
we suspect, the transcriber of this copy. Regiomontanus was
twenty years of age when this manuscript was written (1456), and
we know that he did transcribe numerous mathematical and
astronomical works of historical importance. Algebra was em-
