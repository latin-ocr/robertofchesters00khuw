MANUSCRIPTS OF ROBERT OF CHESTER'S TRANSLATION 57

occurs later in the contiguous text; this type of error is the most
frequent one made in copying Mss. The “jump from like to like ”
is particularly prone to occur when the parallel passages recur in
similar parts of neighboring lines; in this event the omission
approximates the length of a line. Another frequent error in
copying is to omit entirely one or more lines or to repeat a whole
line. An examination of the lengths of all such passages leads
to a fairly definite notion of the length of line of the parent man-
uscript. It need hardly be stated that any omission is more
readily made when the appearance, at least, of sense is preserved
after the omission. In our mathematical text the recurrence of
similar words and phrases is frequent, and in many places the
omission of a line is possible with the preservation of a measure
of meaning.

In Mss. which antedate the tenth century, the length of any
omission is determined with comparative ease as a certain num·
ber of letters, for few abbreviations, and those of a standard type,
were used. However, in Mss. of the type of the Dresden and
Vienna Mss„ with which we are primarily concerned, the length
in letters of any omission is by no means a fixed and definite
quantity. The abbreviations used by the copyists of the twelfth
to the fifteenth century commonly varied, not only from page to
page, but even from line to line. On the first page of the Vienna
ΜΞ. (Plate I), where the conscious effort would be made, probably,
to be uniform in notation, the copyist wrote t'bus in line 18, and
tribus in line 26, while on the following page he wrote thu),
and elsewhere he writes 3¹³⁹). Another possible form is triba
although this does not appear in our Ms. This word then could
count either for 3, 4, 5, or 6 letters. Similarly on this same first
page (line 11) duplicatione is written duplicaffl, while triplicatione,
which immediately follows, is written t'plicatione. In the Dresden
MS. there are entirely similar variations. Thus in line 5 of fol.
340b (Plate II) 5² appears for quinla, in line 7 q'nle for quintae,
quinario in line 15, and ql‘tiqz and qi'cqg in lines 29 and 32 for
qm'nque; in line 37 substanciam appears in full and in the next
line as sabam.

In counting the number of letters in any omission Ι have
assumed the common abbreviations used in the contiguous pas-
sages of the Vienna Ms.; for as that is quite certainly the oldest
