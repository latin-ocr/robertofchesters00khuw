Ninth Problem

Multiply the root of a square by four of its roots in such a way that the
sum total of the multiplication shall equal three squares and 50 units.¹

Explanation. Ι multiply the root by 4 roots and Ι obtain four squares
which are equal to three squares and 50 units. Ι take the 3 squares from the
4 squares, leaving a square equal to 50 units.² Therefore the root of this
square is the root of 50.³ The root of 50 multiplied by 4 roots of 50 gives
200, which is equal to three of the squares and 50 units.

I take from a square one—third of it and three units, and multiply the
remainder by itself ; the product is the square.⁴²

Explanation. When I have subtracted one-third and three units, two-
thirds less three units remain. Now let the square be represented by x3
then we multiply ξ x — 3 units by itself and have ᾖ x² ÷ 9 units — 4 roots
equal to one root. Add the one root to the four roots, giving ξ x² -Ι- 9 units
equal to 5 roots. It is now necessary to complete the four-ninths of a
square, so as to make it a whole square. You multiply each side by ἠέ
giving 11} x equal to x² -4- 2οὲ units. You perform the operations with
these, then, in the manner which we have explained to you in the sections

on the halving of the root.

Eleventh Problem

I multiply one-third of a square by one-fourth of it in such a way that
the sum total of the multiplication will give the square.⁶

Explanation. Ι multiply {x by ἑ (x) and I obtain {- of ὲχῖ equal to x.
The root of the square, then, is 12, and the square is 144⁷

³ Scheybl adds: “The root of fifty multiplied by four roots of 50 gives 200, which is equal to
three of the squares and 50 units.'’ Robert of Chester's text is more closely followed by the
Vienna and Dresden manuscripts.

The symbol for square root xl used by Scheybl was introduced by Adam Riese in his Coss
written in 1524, but not printed until recently (Berlet‚ Leipzig, 1892); for the word Coss see
page 38.

⁴ Rosen, pp. 56—57; Libri, pp. 284—285. In modern notation: (x — ὲ x — 3)² = x. Between
this and the preceding problem the Arabic text includes a problem, leading to the equation z

,τ2 ÷ 20 = 12 x.

⁵ Scheybl adds that you may, if you prefer, divide both sides by ξ.

⁷ In the Arabio text this problem follows: (ὲ x -4- 1)(:¹s x 4- 2)= x -ί- 13.
