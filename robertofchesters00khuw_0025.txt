ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS BEFORE AL—KHOWARIZMI 7

ceeds in the ordinary manner by adding to 896 the square of half
the coefficient of x and then taking the square root of this sum.
From this is subtracted one-half the coefficient of x, giving the
side 28. Four other problems of this series deal with right tri-
angles having rational sides and hypotenuse, in which the sum of
the area and perimeter is to equal a given number. It a, b are
the sides, c the hypotenuse‚ S the area, r radius of the inscribed
circle, and s=}(a÷b÷c), then the solution depends upon the
following formulae:

S=rs=ssab‚ r÷s=a÷b‚ ιτς-ν.

In the sixth book of the Arillznzetica Diophantus treats rational
right triangles in which the area plus or minus one side is a
given number, Orthe area plus or minus the sum of two sides or
one side and the hypotenuse‚ is a given number. Again, such a
problem appears in an algebraic work by Shoja ben Aslam, Aba
Kamil, an Arabic writer of the tenth century.¹

In respect to analysis Diophantus is the greatest name among
the Greeks. Recently it has been established that he flourished
in the third century of the Christian Era, when Greek supremacy
in mathematics was waning. No doubt whatever exists that this
Alexandrian was familiar with the analytical solution of the vari-
ous forms of quadratio equations, neglecting negative roots and, of
course, imaginary roots, which did not receive serious treatment
for more than a millennium after Diophantus. The three types of
complete quadratic equations, involving only positive coefficients,
are the following:

ax2 4- ὀ.τΞ c,
αχ2 -i- c = bx,
ax2 = bx÷ c.

All three types appear in the Ar2·tlmzetz·ca of Diophantus, not
systematically treated but solved as incidental to the solution of

other problems. In fact, after dealing with the solution of equa-

tions of the form
ax⁷²¹ = bx&
