40 INTRODUCTION

prepared for publication the Latin version of Al-Khowarizmi‘s
algebra as translated by Robert of Chester. His manuscript copy
is now in the Columbia University library. The title page¹ reads,
in translation: ‘ A brief and clear exposition of the rules of algebra
by Johann Scheybl, Professor of Euclid in the famous University
of Tiibingen. To this is added the work, On given numbers, by
that most excellent mathematician Jordanus. Furthermore there
is presented the book containing the demonstrations of the rules
of algebraic equations‚ written some time ago in Arabic. All of
‘these are now published for the first time by the above-mentioned
Scheybl. These are corrected as far as possible and illustrated
by appropriate and useful examples.'

The algebra contained in this manuscript is not the same as
the published work mentioned above. However‚ the method of
treatment is not materially different. The work by Jordanus
Nemorarius, entitled De numeris datis, dates from the early part
of the thirteenth century. The importance of the work, chiefly
with respect to the development of algebra, is well attested by the
fact that Regiornontanus and Maurolycus ‘² both planned to publish
the work, although neither carried the plan to completion. The
work was published in 1879 by T1·eutlein.²3 The Scheybl version
contains the complete list of 113 propositions to which Chasles
made reference in 1841. These are divided into four books con-
taining respectively 30, 26, 22 and 35 propositions. Scheybl adds
solutions by the rules of algebra4 in which he employs the same
algebraic notation as in his published algebm, but he does not
give the complete text of the work of Jordanus, The other two
works in the manuscript are presented in this monograph. The
manuscript was carefully prepared, but, for some reason which we
do not know, the publication was not accomplished.
