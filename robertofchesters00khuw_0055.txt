THE INFLUENCE OF AL—KHOWARIZMI'S ALGEBRA 37

ployed by Regiomontanus in his trigonometryl in the solution of
problems.

Regiomontanus has been cited by Nesselmann ² as an illustra-
tion of one who employed rhetorical algebra as opposed to synco-
pated or symbolical. Later writers have followed Nesselmann in
the assertion that Regiomontanus used rhetorical algebra, but,
whereas the statement in Nesselmann is correct in so far as the
illustration which he gives is concerned, the assumption that this
was the general practice of the great Teuton is an error. In
fact, his correspondence with Cardinal Blanchinus shows that he
had a form of equation little inferior to ours. The -1- sign which
he uses is a ligature for ct, the minus sign a ligature for minus,
ancl for an equality sign he uses a single straight line. Further
he has separate symbols for the various powers of the unknown
up to the cube, so that Regiomontanus approached modern forms
more closely than most mathematicians even of the sixteenth
century. This attempted division of the history of algebra into
rhetorical, syncopated‚ and symbolic periods is an excellent illus-
tration of a plausible and taking theory, in historical matters,
which lacks only the first essential for such a theory; namely,
historical evidence. Development in mathematics, as in art and
literature, does not proceed in a logical manner, but rather in
waves advancing and receding, and yet withal constantly
advancing.

We have mentioned the Hebrew translation of the algebra
of Abu KamiL which was made by Mordechai Finzi (about
1475 ΑΒ.) of Mantua. Another treatise on algebra, in Hebrew,
dedicated to Finzi, was written by Simon Motot.³ As the words
cosa and censo are mentioned by Motot as being found in the
works of Christian authors with which he was familiar the
Italian source of his information is established, although the par-
ticular writers in question are not known. As we have above
indicated, the Italians were sufficiently active in this science, so
that many Italian works on algebra were available‚ in manuscript,
at this time.
