ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 135

Now let the point g fall within the side of the square.

Let the square as before be represented by abed and the parallelogram chef,
equivalent to the given number 15, be applied to the side bc. Then upon
half of the line df erect the square gkms. Construct the line co equal to
the line cf and draw the line nhop everywhere equally distant from the line
df. Since the lines dc and cb are equal to each other (being sides of a square),
and further, the lines co and cf equal (by construction), it follows that the
parallelogram do is equal to the parallelogram ce on account of the equality
of the sides. But further, since the two supplementary rectangles go and
om are equal to each other by the forty-third proposition of the first book
of Euchd, by subtracting equals from equals according to the well-known
axiom, the remainders are equal, giving the parallelogram dlz equal to the
parallelogram le together with the square cp. But also since dlz is equal to
the parallelogram go plus the square cp by the thirty-sixth proposition of
the first book'(of Euclid), it follows that these two, the parallelogram go
and the square cp. are equal to the preceding two, the parallelogram le
and the square cp by another well-known axiom.¹ Whence by subtracting
the common part, the square cp, go is equal to the parallelogram le; and in-
deed the lines co and lm are also equal to each other. Further‚ the line
me will be equal to gc, and so also equal to the side of the square lzl.
Since the square gm has a known area, by the fact that its side is one-half
of the given number of roots, if from it there be subtracted 15 which is repre-
sented by the gnomon gfm, circumscribed about the square hl and equal,
as we have just shown, to the parallelogram do, the square hl remains known
in area; whence also the side of it is known. But since this side of the
square lzl is equal to the line gc or me, when added to the half of the number
of the roots ms a side of the square gm, the line ef is then known. And
this is the root of the unknown square. The proposed question is solved.

The geometrical figures follow.

An Illustration of the Third Type

Four roots and twelve units are equal to x2.

The explanation of this type is as follows. Let x² be represented by
the unknown square abed which contains 4 roots and 12 units. From this
square cut off the parallelogram bcef containing four roots. The paral-
lelogram ae consequently will contain precisely 12 units. Then divide the
line ee, representing the number of the roots, into two equal parts by the
point g and upon the side eg erect the square gclzk. Also upon the side
dg erect a square gdml, and let the line ml cut the line es in the point n.
Since the lines ad and dc are equal to each other, and further the lines md

another.''
