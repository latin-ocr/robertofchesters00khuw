THE ARABIC TEXT AND THE TRANSLATIONS 43

The Libri text varies essentially in phraseology and construction
from that by Robert. The Arabic is closely followed up to the
long list of problems‚ “Various QuestionS.‘’ Even here all the
problems with the exception of twol are given in the Latin by
Gerard, but not absolutely in the order in which they occur in the
Arabic. The slight changes in the sequence of problems may
well have been the fault of the particular Arabic manuscript which
Gerard used, if it is not due to some transcriber of Gerard’s work.
One problem which is omitted is not very clear in the Arabic, but
the second omission is a problem of the same type as others which
are given. Some other slight omissions are made in the Latin
text, and the longest of these corresponds to the passage in our
text p. 84, line 25 to p. 86, line 2. Another omission in the Libri
text corresponds to our text, page 74, line 25, quod . . . reperies.
The Libri text also frequently omits the common invocation to
the Deity which is so often interjected by Arabic writers.

The Latin translation by Robert of Chester is not as faithful
nor as correct as the text ascribed to Gerard of Cremona, pub-
lished by Libri. Omissions, transpositions, and additions to the
text are so numerous that it does not seem desirable to list them
all. No evidence exists‚ however, that Robert's text is based
upon another Arabic original than that of the Libri text. The
text proper, as opposed to the illustrative pmblems, follows the
general lines of the Arabic original. The longest omission is the
section dealing largely with the operations upon the square root
of 200, which is illustrated, in the Arabic and in the Libri text,
by geometrical figures with corresponding demonstrations.2

A sentence is left out on page 98 of our text, line 6, after the
word aequiparalur. This sentence Rosen translates, ‘Compute
in this manner every multiplication of the roots, whether the
multiplicatiori be more or less than two.’ Lines 9-11, Natura . . .

¹ Rosen's translation, p. 48, line 15 to p. 50. line 5, and p. 53. lines 12—20. Neither of
these problems is given by Robert of Chester, nor does either appear in the Boncompagni
version. The first problem reads: ⁶· Is some one say: Ἰ have purchased two measures of
wheat or barley. each of them at a certain price, 1 afterwards added the expenses, and the
sum was equal to the difference of the two prices, added to the difference of the measures.⁴ “’
The second reads: “Three-fourths of the fifth osa square are equal to four-fisths of its
root.‘’

‘·‘ Rosen, loc. cit.. p. 27. lines 5-18. and p. 31, line 11, to the bottom of p. 343 Libri,
loc. cit„ p. 269. lines 2—12, and p. 271. line ιᾶρ. 274. line 14. The Libri version omits
the statement of one problem, as stated by Rosen, p. 27, lines 14—16, but the geometrical
explanation is complete.
