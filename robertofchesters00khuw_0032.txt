al-Fz'lzrz'st) by Ibn Abi Ya‘qub al-Nadim. This work, which was
completed about 987 A.D,‚ gives biographies of learned men of all
nations, together with lists of such of their works as were known
to Al-Nadim. We quote the passage relating to our author, re-
garding whose life and activity we have only meagre information.

“ AL-Knovamzm ‘¹

“Mohammed ibn Musa, born in Khowarizm (modern Khiva), worked in the
library of the caliphs under Al-Mamun. During his lifetime, and afterward, where
observations were made, people were accustomed to rely upon his tables, which

were known by the name Sind-Hind (Hindu Siddlzcznta). He wrote: T lte book of
astronomica! rables in two editions, the first and the second ; On tlte sun-dial,-

Neither the date of the birth nor the date of the death of
Al-Khowarizmi has been definitely established. However, the
fact, mentioned by Al-Nadim in the Filzrz'st, that he worked in
the library of the caliph Al-Mamun, who reigned from 813 to 833
A.D.‚ indicates the period of his literary activity. The introduction
to the algebra. which is not found in the extant Latin translations,
is here given in English (p. 45), following Rosen. This brings
further evidence of the acquaintance with Al-Mamun‚ for Al-
Khowarizmi states that the interest of the caliph in science en-
couragecl him to write the treatise¹ The probability is that early
in the reign Of Al-Mamun our author began work upon the Hindu
astronomica] tables which, as the Fihrist account implies‚ brought
him almost immediate fame. This stimulated him to undertake
the work upon algebm, and the success of the second work
induced him to write the treatise on arithmetic in which reference
is made to the algebra. The height of his literary activity may
reasonably be placed about 825 Ap.

The bibliography of Al-Nadim does not include four works
from the hand of Al-Khowarizmi which have come to us. These
are his affithmetic, his algebra, a work on the quadrivium, and an
adaptation of Ptolemy's geography. To Sened ibn ‘Ali, the Jexv,
whose biography immediately follows that of Mohammed ibn
Musa, are ascribed works entitled, On Increasz'ng and Decreasing

(algebraical)‚ lee Book of Algebra, and On the Hindu Art of
Reckom‘ng. The probability is, as Suter points out,1 that an inter-
