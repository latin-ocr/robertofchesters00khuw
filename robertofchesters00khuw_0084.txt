58 INTRODUCTION

of the Mss. which we are examining, it is in all probability more
nearly like the parent ΜΞ. whose existence is established with
considerable certainty by our study. On the first page of the
Vienna Ms. (Plate I) the line varies in length from 35 to 48
letters, with an average of 4οὲ letters, while on the first half of
fol. 340b of the Dresden Ms. the line varies from 40 to 52 letters
with an average of 45} letters These facts give an indication of
the latitude in variation which we may assume in the line length
of the parent Ms.

The omissions of the Vienna ΜΞ. will first be investigated as
that is the oldest of our texts. In the text of page 84, lines 7—9‚
the parent Ms. evidently read:

Sed linea b h similis est linee g d. Nam quoniam linea g l et
linea h e in quantitate habentur consimiles quoniam linea g 1
similis est linee d e.

The Vienna scribe passed from the first similis est linee to the
second. In the text of the same page, lines 12—13:

Area igitur quam linee t e, e a circumdant similis est aree quarn
linee m l, l d circumdant. Area igitur . . .

The scribe dropped from the one Area zgrz'lnr to the other.

In the text given in lines 8—9 of the footnote to lines 1—12‚
page 88:

. similis est aree quam c t, t lsimilis quam t e circumdant.
Area ergo n Z similis est aree . . . the scribe of the Vienna ΜΞ.
passed from the first similis est aree to the second. On page 112,
text of lines 1-4:

. . absque xx rebus. Rern quoque in re multiplicata, et erit
substantia. Hec insimul iunge et erunt c et due substantie
absque xx rebus. The omission can be conceived of here as of
the text between absque and absque, or xx and xx, or between
rebus and rebus, and similarly in the preceding illustrations. So
in line 18, page 116 (footnote): in duo et 4² et erunt xx et 4¹³, et
multiplica v radices in duo et 4¹² et erunt 11 res et 4¹³. . . . the
text is omitted between any word of the first 2'72 duo et 71² el erunt
and the same word where this phrase recurs.

These five passages are in length, roughly, 45, 43, 38, 54 to 60,
and 41 letters, respectively. They indicate a line length of about
40 letters in the parent Ms. One omission which is not from like
to like appears to be that of a complete line in the text of page 104,
