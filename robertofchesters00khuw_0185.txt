ADDITIONS TO THE ALGEBRA 155

Rule. Let x represent the one quantity, and say, since the lesser quan-
tity divided by the greater gives one-half of the greater, that consequently
the lesser multiplied by one-hali of the greater gives the greater quantity.
But two times one-half of the greater quantity gives also the greater quan-
tity. Therefore 2 is the value of the lesser quantity, and 4 is the greater.

F ourteentlz question

Ι divided 10 into two parts, and Ι multiplied one by the other and divided
the product by the difference between the two, obtaining 5} as the result.
The question is, what are the parts? The answer is 3 and 7.

Rule. Multiply x by 10 — x, giving 10x —- x²3 then divide 10x — x²
by 10 — 2 x, which is the difference between the parts, and 5} is obtained.
Now, on the other hand, if you multiply 5} by 10 — 2 x, you will obtain
10 x - x2. Hence multiply 5} by 10 — 2 x, which gives 52} units — 10} x,
all of which is equal to 10 x — x2. Observe, then, that by restoring to the
10 x and to the units (the quantities, x² and 10} x respectively, which are
subtracted from them) 20} x. is equal to 52} units 4- x2. Operate there-
fore by the chapter in which squares and numbers are equal to roots, multi-
plying the half of the roots by itself, and there will result 10 51¹5, etc.

F isteentlz question

Four roots ot a square multiplied by five roots of the same square give
double the square and 36. The question is as to the square. The answer
in accordance with the rule is 2.

Rule. Multiply 4 x by 5x, giving 20 x2, which equals 2 x² -†- 36 units.
Hence divide 36 by 18, giving 2 as the result. And this amount is the square,
which may be tested.

Sixteentlz question

Ι subtracted from a quantity one-third of it and three unitsy then Ι
multiplied the remainder by itself, restoring the quantity itself by this
multiplicatiori. The question is, how great is the quantity? The answer
in accordance with the rule is 9.

Rule. Subtracting ὲ x ἦ- 3 (units) from ἐκ, there remain ξ x — 3 units,
which is the root of the quantity (x.) Therefore multiply {x — 3 units by
itself, giving 244,- x² 4- 9 units — 4 x, and that is equal to the root (x). Hence
ξ x² ψ 9 units equals 5 x. You reduce the ξ to a whole square by multiply-
ing it, and also the units and the 5 x, by ἢ, and you will find that x² 4- 2οὲ
units is equal to 11} x. operate then by the chapter in which squares and
numbers are equal to roots. Taking the half of the roots, 55, and multiply-
ing it by itself‚ you have 3134} : from this subtract 20}‚ there remains 1 1}{, of
which the root is 3} Add this to the half of the roots, since by subtraction

you will not arrive at the desired result, and 9 appears as the quantity
which you seek. ’
