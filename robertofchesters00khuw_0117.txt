ten of its roots which we desired to demonstrate.¹

CONCERNING Roors AND NUMBERS EQUAL To A SQUARE

Three roots and four are equal to x2.

I suppose a square, which is α b c d, of which the sides are unknown3 this
square, as we have said,
equals three roots and four in
number. If one side of any
square is multiplied by unity
you necessarily obtain one

constituting the number of
the roots; let this side be the line a e. Now it is clear to us that the area
e c amounts to the four which is added to the roots. Hence we bisect the
side a e, representing three roots, at the point g. Upon this half construct
a square, which is g k l e. Ι say that this square is made by the multiplica-
tion of half of the roots by itself, that is, produced by one and one-half
multiplied by itself. Then to the line g k we add the line k m, which is equal
ᾗ to the line e d. The line g m equals the line g
d, thus forming a square which is g 0. Since
α d is equal to es and g d equal to e n, as
they occur in the square g ο, it is evident
that g a is left equal to n s. The line g ais

equal to the line g e, being half of the roots,
that is, bisecting the roots, and it is further
true that g e equals k l, for each measures
e f the breadth of the area e m. Therefore k l
-- equals n s. Again since d g equals e n,

Rosen. The translation follows the Vienna version. The figure to be used in the geometrical
demonstration to obtain by addition the second root of the given quadratic equation appears at
the bottom of the preceding page. (Fig. 10.) The Boncompagni version (loc. cit. p. 35> varies
by letting the middle point fall first within the side of the first square, and secondly without:
Cum itaque dividitur per medium linea b e ad punctum z, cadet ergo inter puncta g e aut 1> g z
sit hoc prius inter puncta b g.
