RULES CORRESPONDING TO THE SIX CHAPTERS OF
ALGEBRA

First. When roots are equal to a number, divide the number by (the
number of) the roots, and the quotient represents the desired quantity.¹

Second. When squares are equal to a number, divide the number by
(the number of) the squareS, and the root of that which you obtain repre-
sents the desired quantity?

Third. When roots are equal to squares, divide (the number of) the roots
by (the number of) the squares, and the quotient represents the desired
quantity.³

Fourtlz. When a number is equal to the sum of squares and roots, divide
by (the number of) the squares. Take one-half of (the number of) the
roots after the division and multiply it by itself. To this product add the
number. The root of this sum less one-half of the number of roots‚ repre-
sents that which is sought.4

F istlz. When roots are equal to a number and squares, divide the roots
and the number by (the number of) the squares. Take one-half of (the
number of) the roots after the division, and multiply it by itself. From this
product subtract the number; the root of the remainder subtracted from
one-half of (the number of) the roots is the desired quantity.⁵ But if it is
not possible ⁶ to subtract the root of the remainder from one-half of (the
number of) the roots, it is permissible to add the same.

S ixtlz. When squares are equal to a number and roots, on this side divide
by (the number of) the squares. Take one-half of (the number of) the roots
after the division, and multiply it by itself. To this product add the
number; the root of this sum plus one—half of (the number of) the roots
represents that which is sought.⁷

⁵ It is always possible to subtract the root of the rernainder here from one-half of the num-
ber οἱ the roots, even from the standpoint of the mathematician of the fourteenth century who
made this table of rules, for the remainder would always be positive, since the square root of
(bsz α)2 — nf‘a is always less than bs'z α.
