Yet another problem: how much is 10 -4- x by x — 10? 10 multiplied
byx gives 10 x, and x by x gives positive x²; also 10 by negative 10 gives
100 units negative, and x multiplied by negative 10 gives negative 10 x.
You can say, therefore, that this sum total amounts to x2 less 100 units.

If moreover some one asks what is the product of 10 units and one-half x
multiplied by one-half a unit less 5 x, you proceed thus: 10 multiplied by
one-half a unit gives 5 units and one-half of x by one-half a unit gives one-
fourth x ; also 10 by negative 5 x gives negative 50 x. Whence the sum total
of this multiplication amounts to 5 units‚ from which are to be subtracted ¹
49 x and {xx Then {x multiplied by negative 5 x gives two and one-half
x² negative. The sum total of the multiplicatiori amounts to 5 units‚ with
two and one-half x²‚ and 49x and {x to be subtracted.2

Another problem: how much is 10 -Ι- x multiplied by x — 10? This
is the same as x 4- 10 by x — 10. Whence you proceed in this manner:
x multiplied by x gives x‘2‚ and 10 by x gives 10 positive roots; also x multi-
plied by negative 10 gives negative 10 x. Whence the 10x to be added
(positive) and the 10x to be subtracted (negative), or taken away, cancel
each other, since the first adds as much as the second takes away and x²
alone remains. Then 10 by negative 10 gives 100 units to be subtracted
from x2. This total product therefore amounts to x‘2 less³ 100 units.

ΟΝ INCREASING AND DIMINISHING4

The fact must be recognized that every root of any given square is
unknown3 it is also doubled or tripled, etc. in such a way that by doubling
and tripling it, by the multiplication of its square, a number is formed of
which one root is equal to two or three roots of the given unknown square.
All of this turns out to be like the multiplication of any number beyond
unity, all in natural order. For if you wish to double the roots, you multiply

³ Scheybl writes adiectis for abiectis. The problem is, of course, that x -ψ- 10 multiplied by
,τ — 10 gives .r'-’ — 100.

⁴ An algebraical work with this title is supposed to have been written by ALKhowarizmi.

The Libri and the Arabic versions follow with four problems which do not occur in Robert of
Chester's translation. However, Scheybl takes up three of these problems in his additions, on
pages 142—144 of this work.

These problems, following Rosen, op. rit„ p. 27, are as follows: ⁴‘ Know that the root of two
hundred minus ten, added to twenty minus the root of two hundred, is just ten. The root of
two hundred, minus ten, subtracted from twenty minus the root of two hundred, is thirty minus
twice the root of two hundred; twice the root of two hundred is equnl to the root of eight
hundred. A hundred and a square minus twenty roots, added to fifty and ten roots minus two
squares, is a hundred and fifty, minus a square and minus ten roots. A hundred and a square,
minus twenty roots. diminished by fifty and ten roots minus two squares. is fifty dirhems and
three squares minus thirty roots. I shall hereafter explain to you the reason of this by a figure,
which will be annexed to this chapter.''
