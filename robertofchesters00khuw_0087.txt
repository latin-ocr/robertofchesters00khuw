MANUSCRIPTS OF ROBERT OF CHESTER'S TRANSLATION 61

in agreement with Scheybl's reading as opposed to the Vienna
reading. Thus on page 66 of our text the marginal notes to words
in lines 17 and 18 alii centenum and alii decem, and on page 68 to
a word in linc 2, aliz· coniunctis. Four rather long marginal cor-
rections are made, also apparently based upon the Vienna manu—
script, in the text to page 92, line 1, in the text as given in note
6 on the same page, in the text given on page 94, lines 34—36,
and on page 96, line 17.

We have found then in each of these two manuscripts seven
definite indications of a parent manuscript with a line length of
between 36 and 54 letters, not very different from the line length
in these Mss. themselves. But aside from the line length of the
parent there are other indications that the two Mss. have a com-
mon parent. In the text of page 86, line 15, both Mss. read cx
duobus el quarta ιἰι sc· ipsis where the sense requires ex unitate et
medietate in sc ζ’ῥςίςς this error was evidently in the parent Μὰ,
and possibly in the autograph. Similarly in the text of page 106,
lines 1 1 and 14, both Mss. read plainly 36, and that twice, whereas
49 is the correct numerical result here. The scribe of the Dresden
ΜΞ. commonly (5 times) writes lziz's and the other scribe llis, but
in the text of page 76, line 15, this procedure is reversed; the in—
dicationis that lzz‘z‘s was the form employed in the parent. The
Dresden scribe writes addicias and the Vienna scribe adicias, ex-
cept in the text of page 76, line 20 where the latter also writes
afficiam probably this form was used in the parent Ms. In the
text of page 102, line 26, the Vienna MS. reads 10 sine re, and the
Dresden Ms. rem, while the sense requires 10 res sine substantia.
Either the translation was incorrect in the parent, or, more prob-
ably, the passage was illegible. In the text of page 112, line 22,
the Vienna Ms. reads 2000, 500, 50 et 4³, for 2550 cl 4³; the
Dresden Ms. writes the expression in words. This corresponds
to a direct translation from the Arabic, for most early mathemati-
cal Mss. in Arabic follow the practise of writing numbers in full
numeral words, and not in Hindu-Arabic notation.

The discussion of Scheybl's text is somewhat more complicated
than that of the two preceding, for Scheybl follows sometimes the
one. sometimes the other, and frequently neither, of the two older
texts. As we have indicated above, there is probability that thc
present Vienna text may have been in the library of the Univer-
