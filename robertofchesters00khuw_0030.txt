1 2 INTRODUCTION

artificial effort of human ingenuity, but rather the natural expres-
sion of man's interest in the numerical side of the universe of
thought. Tables of square and cubic numbers in Babylon3 geo-
metric progressions. involving the idea of powers, together with
linear and quadratic equations in Egypt; the so-called Pythago-
rean theorem in India, and possibly in China, before the time of
Pythagoras3 and the geometrieal solution of quadratio equations
even before Euclid in Greece‚ are not isolated facts of the history of
mathematics. While they do indeed mark stages in the develop-
ment of pure mathematics‚ this is only a small part of their signifi-
cance. More vital is the implication that the algebraical side of
mathematics has an intrinsic interest for the human mind not
conditioned upon time or place, but dependent simply upon the
development of the reasoning faculty. We may say that the
study of powers of numbers, and the related study of quadratic
equations, were an evolution out of a natural interest in numbers;
the facts which we have presented are traces of the process of this
evolution.
