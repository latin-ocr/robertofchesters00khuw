2 by 2, and the product by the unknown square of the same root. The
result will be a number of which one root will be equal to two roots of the
given unknown square.1 And if you wish to triple the root, you multiply
3 and 3, and the product by the square of the root; so you obtain a number
of which one root is equal to three roots of the first square.² Moreover, if
you wish to take one-half oi a root, it is necessary to multiply one-half by
one-half. and then the product by the square itseli. The root which is
taken will be one—half of the root of the given square.³ Indeed the nature
of numbers requires that just as integral numbers are multiplied so also are
lesser numbers, i.e. fractions. You proceed then in the same manner with
thirds, with fourths‚ and so with every number less than an integer3 illus-

First illustration⁵t Take the root of nine to be multiplied. If you wish
to double the root of nine you proceed as follows 1 2 by 2 gives 4, which you
multiply by 9, giving 36. Take the root of this, i.e. 6, which is found to be
two roots of nine, i.e. the double of three. For three, the root of nine, added
to itself gives 6.ὃ

Second illustration: If you wish to triple the root of 9, you multiply 3
by 3, giving 97 which multiplied by itseli, ie by 9, gives 81. Of this number
9 is the root, and this is seen to be equal to 3 roots oi 9, i.e. 3 >< 3.⁷

Third illustration: if, however, you wish to take one-half of the root,
multiply one-half by one-half, giving ὲ which when multiplied by 9 will
give ΖΞ. Take the root of this. i.e. 1{‚ which is one-half of the root of 9,

⁴ This section begins in the Arabic with the four problems which we have given in footnote
4 on the preceding page of the translation The part which corresponds to this paragraph,
following Rosen, pp. 27-28, is as follows: ‘If you require to double the root of any known or
unknown square (the meaning of its duplication being that you multiply it by two), then it
will suffice to multiply two by two, and then by the square; the root of the product is equal to
twice the root oi the original square.

Ii you require to take it thrice, you multiply three by three, and then by the square; the
root oi the product is thrice the root of the original square.

Compute in this manner every multiplicatiori of the roots whether the multiplicatiori be
more or less than two.

Ii you require to find the moiety of the root of the square, you need only multiply a half by
a half, which is a quarter; and then this by the square: the root oi the product will be half
the root oi the first square.

Follow the same rule when you seek for a third, or a quarter of a root, or any larger or
smaller quota oi it, whatever may be the denominator or the numerator. Examples of this . . . ¹

θ 2 ΝΙξ = *lgr—*9 = 6. The problems may appear trivial, but the reader should note that this
is the first approach to an algebraic treatment in systematic form of surd quantities. Al-Kho-
warizmi proceeds admirably from known to unknown,
