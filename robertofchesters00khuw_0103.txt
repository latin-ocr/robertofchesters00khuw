Having taken then the square root of this which is 8, subtract from it the
half of the roots, 5, leaving 3. The number three therefore represents one
root of this square, which itself, of course, is 9. Nine therefore gives that
square.¹

Similarly however many squares are proposed all are to be reduced to
one square. Similarly also you may reduce whatever numbers or roots
accompany them in the same way in which you have reduced the squares.

The following is an example of this reduction: two squares and ten
roots equal 48 units.2 The question therefore in this type of equation is
something like this: what are the two squares which when combined are
such that 11 ten roots of them are added, the sum total equals 48? First
of all it is necessary that the two squares be reduced to one. But
since one square is the half of two. it is at once evident that you should
divide by two all the given terms in this problem. This gives a square
and 5 roots equal to 24 units. The meaning 01 11115 15 about as follows:
what is the square which amounts to 24 when you add to it 5 of its roots?
At the outset it is necessary, recalling the rule above given, that you take
one-half 01 the roots. This gives two and one-half⁷ which multiplied by
itself gives ὑὲ. Add this to 24, giving 30} Take then of this total the
square root, which is, of course, 53. From this subtract half of the
roots, 2ὲ, leaving 3, which expresses one root 01 the square, which itself
is 9.

Another possible example: half a square and five roots are equal to 28
1111115.3 The import 01 11115 problem is something like this: what is the
square which is such that when to its half you add five of its roots the sum
total amounts to 28? Now however it is necessary that the square, which
here is given as less than awhole square, should be completed.4 Therefore the
half of 11115 square together with the roots which accompany it must be
doubled. We have then, a square and 10 10015 equal to 56 units. There—
